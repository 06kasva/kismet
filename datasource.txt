Datasource

    - Local_List
        - Does not instantiate fully registered datasource

        - Return immediate list of interfaces if able to probe with
          local code / unprivileged code

        - Otherwise

        - Launch binary via IPC
        - Return IPC entry
        - Async collection of interfaces by datasourcetracker

        - Spawn IPC source with CLI options to list interfaces
        - Return valid local sources via device listing

    - Local_Probe
        - Does not instantiate fully registered datasource

        - Return immediate success if able to probe with local
          code / unprivileged code

        - Otherwise

        - Launch binary via IPC
        - Return IPC entry
        - Async collection of response by datasourcetracker

        - Spawn IPC source with CLI option to probe interface
        - Return valid or invalid

    - Create_Local
        - Instantiate a local datasource

        - DST calls us with an interface object
        - Place it in the interface
        - IPC deframer calls Handle_Frame

    - Create_Network
        - Instantiate a local endpoint for a remote datasource

        - Remote connection brokered by Datasourcetracker
        - DST calls us with an interface object
        - Deframer in Datasourcetracker calls Handle_Frame

    - Create_Passive
        - Instantiate a local datasource with no framer connection

        - Called once datasourcetracker is ready

        - Used for web based arbitrary input
        - Allows us to associate network events and packets with a datasource

    - Close
        - Close any opened instance (local or remote)
        - Send shutdown over control

    - Channel set
        - Set channel
        - Command queued via framer; same command used for local or remote

    - Configure
        - Re-open source if there's an error

    - Capture info
        - reported as string
        - 'Local + PID'
        - 'Passive'
        - 'Remote + Host'

    - Handle_Frame (Handles datasource control frame independent of frame source)

    - Built-in frame handlers
        - Handle_PACKET
        - Handle_CHANNEL
        - Handle_CLOSE
        - Handle_ERROR
        - Handle_GPS
