Aug 01 2005  devel  After hearing about a presentation criticizing handling of
                     unprintable characters in the SSID, modified how SSIDs
                     are munged to printable to make non-standard charachters
                     represented by \OCT (see man ascii)
                    Tweaked new munger code to handle ' ' better (ttuttle)
Jul 25 2005 2005-07 Released 2005-07-R1a source.  These are minor changes to 
                     fix a last-minute BSD compilation problem, anyone not on
                     BSD doesn't need to worry about it and there will not be
                     new binary packages.
Jul 24 2005 2005-07 Released 2005-07-R1.  This is mostly a bugfix and minor
                     feature enhancement release.  Fixes and additions include:
                     - Linux Radiotap support
                     - Wrt54g support on openwrt and (likely) ddwrt
                     - Radiotap _DBM_x support
                     - Full WPA/WPA2 detection for WEP40, WEP104, TKIP, PSK,
                       AES-OCB, AES-CCM, WPA, and WPA2
                     - Fixes to compilation under some compilers
                     - Segfault fixes to kismet_client
                     - OpenBSD fixes and configuration updates
Jul 21 2005  devel  Fixed rendering negative signal levels in kismet_client to
                     reflect actual strength properly
                    Changed wrt54g source to try to fall back to 'wl monitor' if
                     the ioctls don't seem to be available
                    Tweaked best signal handling to deal with negatives better
Jul 20 2005  devel  Added Radiotap DBM_x field support
Jul 19 2005  devel  Moved radiotap support to work on Linux as well, to coincide
                     with my ieee80211/ipw2200 patches to bring radiotap over.
                     A bit of a kluge, but sufficient for now.
Jul 08 2005  devel  Merged stage1 of patches from Pedro for configure to allow
                     disabling all gpsmap tests and compilation
                    Removed HAVE_GPS ifdefs from the code, since the option
                     was no longer supported and removing the def caused
                     compile time errors
Jun 30 2005  devel  Merged OpenBSD config patches and RADIOTAP_F_FCS patches
                     from Pedro
Jun 28 2005  devel  Fixed WPA reporting when the first packet isn't WPA
                    Added WPA2-AES detection
                    Rewrote WPA detection to do full WPA header decoding
                    Added WEP40, WEP104, TKIP, PSK, AES-OCB and AES-CCM
                     detection
                    Fixed gcc-3.4.x compilation
                    Tweaked client for slightly better performance
                    Fixed issue where re-grouping an auto-group led to 
                     Bad Things in the client
                    Rewrote chunks of group management code, possibly resolving
                     lurking segfault in client
Jun 25 2005  devel  Added support for new wrt54g revisions/firmwares that use
                     prism0 for monitor data.  Set your capture type to
                     wrt54g,eth1:prism0,foo
Jun 21 2005 2005-06 Released 2005-06-R1.  Major code improvements and bugfixes,
                     including:
                     OpenBSD radiotap support
                     New gpsd interface code
                     Segfault fixes
                     IPW2200 Linux support
                     IPW2915 Linux support
                     Client updates (follow mode, segfaults, packet rate, 
                                     speed increases)
                     Fixed WPA detection
                     Cygwin fixes
                     IP detection rewrite and fixes
                     Reduced binary size by 100k for server/drone
                     Flite speech support
                     Drone GPS fixes
                     Autoconf fixes on RH and other distros
                     RT8180 Linux support
                     GPSMap speedups
                     GPSMap deprecation of broken sources
                     Various packet dissection fixes
                     Lots of other updates and bugfixes.
Jun 21 2005  devel  Merged patches from Pedro for OpenBSD ralink, prism2, and
                     readme
                    Deprecated broken gpsmap sources and set default to blank
                    Added "--disable-optimization" flag to turn off -Ox
Jun 20 2005  devel  Fixed condition where gps mode wasn't updated 
                    Updated to libpcap 0.9.1-kis
                    Patched libpcap to not include filtering code.  Kismet
                     doesn't use it, and its 100k of binary we can drop
Jun 19 2005  devel  Added more wireless vendors to the manuf map
Jun 18 2005  devel  Updated AP manuf/defaults info
                    Rewrote GPSD handling to be more like newcore, to correctly
                     handle error conditions with ESRs new GPSD code
                    Rewrote distance and heading code to (hopefully) clear
                     up some bugs
                    Fixed 'follow gps' in client (broken in -devel only)
                    Fixed 'follow network' heading calculations in client
                    Fixed range to only show 3 significant digits in client
Jun 13 2005  devel  Fixed a pile of little broken parts of code thanks to a
                     pass through a static code analyser
Jun 11 2005  devel  Fixed compile error on wsp100 capture type, but I suspect
                     the capture source has other problems still.
                    Updated README, added some FAQs in the silly hope someone
                     will read them.
                    Fixed minor linewrap issues in display
                    Fixed minor rate graph issue where it overflowed the box,
                     still sometimes looks too small
Jun 09 2005  devel  Fixed stupid error introduced last night in new prism2 code
                    Merged patch from Pedro for fbsd compat
                    Changed net/cli info 'WEP' to 'Privacy'
                    Added ad-hoc autogrouping to kismet_client
Jun 08 2005  devel  Tweaked prism2 pcap header length handling for extra safety
                    Tweaked configure to error out on socklen_t properly on
                     cygwin
Jun 05 2005  devel  Fixed segfault on some conditions in kismet_client
                     group management code
                    Fixed segfaults in tcpclient code and corrupted protocol
                     lines (non-exploitable)
                    Added W(O) documentation to client help
Jun 03 2005  devel  Minor code format changes, possible fd-exhaustion bug on 
                     OpenBSD fixed
Jun 02 2005  devel  Removed theoretical loophole in bss-timestamp finitestate
Jun 01 2005  devel  README changes
May 31 2005  devel  Fixed segfault condition in kismet_client caused by the 
                     "powerbar" column or "Signal Levels" window and funny
                     signal levels
                    Added "netfuzzycrypt" option, defaulted to true.  This uses
                     the network classifier to force a fuzzy encryption on
                     unencrypted data frames classified as part of an encrypted
                     network.
                    More fixes to IP handling -- client aggregation works
                     better now when finding a network IP
                    Fixed sigfpu/channel sets for real
May 30 2005  devel  Added 'flite' config parameter for 'festival lite', if
                     using flite instead of festival, set it to true
                    Fixed client signal/noise levels in kismet_client
May 27 2005  devel  Merged README updates and OpenBSD updates from Pedro
                    Merged OpenBSD channel display from pedro
                    Added ipw2915 packet source for centrinto a/g cards.
                     Same as the 2200, just has the default channels set to 
                     include 11a.
                    Fixed sigfpu failure if the default channel sets are
                     missing
                    Added OpenBSD workaround for atheros FCS bytes
May 26 2005  devel  Moved to drone protocol 9.  Drone GPS status is now carried
                     in the version packet.  If GPS is enabled on the drone,
                     it will be used for coordinates, if it is not, the server GPS
                     will be used.
                    Updated README and some error messages
                    Took default carrier type out of packet reporting since it
                     could give bad info
                    Fixed several segfaults in kismet_client caused by groups
                     or networks being auto-deleted (like probe_networks being 
                     merged)
                    Sped up kismet_client a fair bit (only recalculate groups
                     when we need to)
                    Merged burst-rate-unit alert support from newcore-devel.
                     You can now set a timeunit for burstrates of alerts, ie
                     10/min burst of 1/sec.
                    Reverted UpdateNetworks() in panelfront so that it would
                     update idle dieoff correctly again
                    Fixed minor bug in pcapsource avs parsing
May 25 2005  devel  Configure changes for openbsd (pedro)
                    Tweaked cisci_wifix error message
                    Introduced a slight delay into the channel control process
                     for ipw2200 to prevent channel sets immediately on top of
                     one another causing the card to stop seeing packets.
May 24 2005  devel  Fixed configure on RH and other distros that modify it so
                     you can't use kernel headers
                    Copied latest automake config.sub and config.guess
                    Merged set of updates from Pedro to handle Open/Net BSD
                     capture devices (Yup, OpenBSD 3.7 support)
May 21 2005  devel  Fixed panels client displaying garbage data for battery
                     percentage while charging
May 20 2005  devel  Fixed up WPA more to handle multiple tag 221 instances
May 19 2005  devel  Changed WPA detection to use more of the tagged parm to
                     determine the encryption, should prevent false positives
                     on "capable but not enabled" APs
                    Fixed some relatively small memory leaks
May 18 2005  devel  Backed out my BROKEN ipw2200 sw_reset and followed James' 
                     advice to set the channel to 0 to restore scanning mode.
                     ipw2200 appears to come out of monitor mode cleanly now.
                    Fixed FloatChan2Int not handling absolute channels from the
                     driver layer.  I thought I'd merged a patch from someone to
                     do just this, but...
                    Dropped packet counter no longer includes phy frames
May 17 2005  devel  Added ipw2200 support with temporary sw_reset support to try
                     to come out of monitor mode.  You'll need the 1.0.4 drivers
                     and new firmware, and you can force a reset of the card by
                     reloading the drivers
                    Added ipw2200 to fuzzy crypt list
                    Tweaked IP detection to not attempt to process IPs for any
                     packet associated with an encrypted network
May 15 2005  devel  Added auth frames to the probe network classifier (auth to
                     unknown network creates a probe net, auth to known network
                     acts normally)
May 06 2005  devel  Fixed another glaring inefficiency in gpsmap, providing an
                     order of magnitude speed boost to interpolated power calcs.
May 05 2005  devel  Fixed a bunch of ops that didn't need to be done in inverse
                     weighting in gpsmap   
Apr 18 2005  devel  Changed WPA detection to only trigger when the WEP flag is also
                     set.  APs advertise WPA capability even when encryption isn't
                     turned on, it seems reasonable to cloak that if it isn't 
                     actually being used.
                    Tentatively changed docs to call rt2x00 'ralink' instead of
                     'realtek', though I still haven't seen anything to prove it
                     one way or the other.
                    Tweaked gpsmap to handle WPA w/ no WEP as non-wep (plotting
                     data the same as its handled in -devel now)
Apr 09 2005  devel  Added RT8180 capture support
Apr 02 2005 2005-04 Released 2005-04-R1.  Primarily a bugfix release, but with
                     some new features, including:
                     GPSD reconnection fixes
                     LEAP/TKIP/EAP/WPA/PPTP detection
                     Better momentary card failure handling on channel control
                     Various compile-time issues with ImageMagick APIs
                     String handling cleanup
                     Major fixes to IP guessing
                     rt2x00 support
                     Interface binding
Mar 30 2005  devel  Fixed another case of bad IP discovery
Mar 23 2005  devel  Fixed xml parsing error in expat.cc and new encryption
                     fields.  You'll want to purge your old cache files.
Mar 22 2005  devel  Changed IP detection algorithms to ignore TCP and UDP frames
                     sourced from the AP.  This should avoid most of the IP detection
                     problems caused by AP/routers which source remote IP data
                     from the local MAC.
Mar 21 2005  devel  Added "consecutive failure" support to card channel control.
                     For drivers with intermittent failure changing channel,
                     this will delay Kismet exiting until 5 failures in a row
                     occur.
Mar 15 2005  devel  Merged patch from Josh Wright to add PPTP detection of some L3
                     VPNs.  This slightly breaks old-client compatability in that a
                     L3 VPN network will show up as WEP in old clients.
Mar 13 2005  devel  Reverted crypt_set to push out 'wep' protocol field for 
                     backwards compatability.  Same data, old field name.
Mar 10 2005  devel  Merged long-delayed patch from Josh Wright to add detection
                     for LEAP, TLS, TTLS, PEAP, and ISAKMP exchanges in networks.
                    Expanded "wep" attribute to "cryptset".  WEP is still reported
                     when a network uses encryption (WEP/Privacy bit is set), and
                     network details show the encryption options.  Networks with
                     extra encryption are listed as 'O'ther in the client.
                    Expanded XML, ascii, csv logs
                    Added/fixed client WEP fields
                    Fixed bug that caused some removed networks to not be sent for
                     removal if the times collided
                    Added very basic WPA detection and reporting
Mar 07 2005  devel  Merged patch from Chris Kuethe cleaning up some possible
                     over-by-one string parsing and to remove two warnings.
Feb 08 2005  devel  Merged patch from Mindfab to potentially resolve some of the
                     problems with gpsd reconnecting.  Untested at the moment
                     since I don't have my GPS handy.
Feb 06 2005  devel  Merged patch from Delicious Nougat to handle binding only
                     to the specified address for TCP servers, vs. INADDR_ANY.
                    Currently left in the config to bind to localhost only,
                     I've not yet decided if this will be the default for the
                     next release or if the default will be ANY.
Feb 03 2005  devel  Added support for the rt2x00 11b and 11g cards for the
                     drivers to be released shortly
Jan 26 2005  devel  Added typedef for MagickBooleanType on old IM libs
Jan 17 2005  devel  Updated ipkg spec
                    Changed configure to accept --with-linuxheaders for 
                     cross-compiling with a different kernel header path
                     than the current /lib/modules/...
Jan 13 2005 2005-01 Released 2005-01-R1.  Not the major rewrite yet, sorry,
                    pushed out for the CHIP magazine CD.  Minor bugfixes and 
                    general updates:
                     Fixed non-intel compilation bugs in previous release
                     Fixed gcc version issues that crept into previous release
                     Tweaked ipw2100 channel control to try to minimize driver 
                      errors
                     Tweaked signal/noise handlers to work with Madwifi again
                     Added Atmel-USB support (rudimentary pseudo-rfmon)
                     Tweaked configure scripts
                     Fixed alpha blending elements of gpsmap images on new 
                      image magick libs
                     Fixed label positioning code in gpsmap
                     Documentation and spelling errors fixed up
Jan 13 2005  devel  Tweaked configure.in/configure to use $(...) instead of `...`
                     to find the kernel headers since it seems to not always
                     translate correctly (Andreas 'GlaDiaC' Schneider)
Jan 11 2005  devel  Added card type 'atmel_usb' for the berlios.de atmel USB 
                     drivers with pseudo-monitor support
Jan 09 2005  devel  Minor tweak to signal/noise handlers to report the signal
                     level if noise is equal to 0.  (This fixes behavior on
                     madwifi drivers that report a signal and no noise)
Jan 03 2005  devel  Merged documentation spelling patch from Andreas Mohr
Jan 01 2005  devel  Merged gpsmap patch from Daniel Dorau to fix gpsmap alpha
                     blending on imagemagick 6.x, label positioning bugs, and a
                     cleaner text drawer for labels.

Nov 15 2004  devel  Tweaked includes in ringbuf.h to handle stdint.h correctly
Nov 04 2004  devel  Tweaked macaddr.h again to try to appease different gcc
                     versions.
Nov 01 2004  devel  Tweaked endian_magic and mac_addr - should compile
                     cleanly on non-linux systems and on gcc 2.95 now.

                      configure
                     Lots of other bug fixes
                     Trimmed CHANGELOG file to only this year

                     in some systems
Jun 18 2004  devel  Changed string = char * to string = string(char *) since
                     cygwin seems to have broken constructors for that
                     (thanks JM)
                    Added checks to hopefully bypass fetching channels from
                     down interfaces under hostap which led to failures from
                     driver crankiness
Jun 14 2004  devel  Added channel to alert tracking and protocol
Jun 13 2004  devel  Merged fix from Million to repair delta calculations and
                     fix playing the correct sound for traffic
Jun 10 2004  devel  Expanded alert protocol to carry source, dest, bssid, and
                     other mac address fields for better programatic handling
                     of alerts through external clients
Jun 09 2004  devel  Added BSS timestamp spoof detection - BSSTIMESTAMP alert.
                    Created "None" packet source for default config to stem
                     the new people being confused with cisco errors
                    Modified packetsource unmonitor_ code to not print warnings
                     about not leaving monitor mode cleanly if not relevant for
                     all active packetsources (ie, pcapfile and drones don't
                     warn about trying to disable rfmon)
Jun 06 2004  devel  Merged patch from Michael Scherer to fix gcc3.4 compiling
May 30 2004  devel  Fixed docs for OpenBSD
                    Merged patch from KW which should fix the problems on 64bit
                     platforms.
                    Merged patches from TZ to add more delays into monitor code
                     to make Socket CF cards happy
May 15 2004  devel  Added support for ipw2100 (Centrino) cards using the latest
                     drivers from sourceforge.
                    Merged patch from Antonio Eugenio Burriel for proper 
                     channel detection with drivers that report channel
                     number instead of frequency
May 14 2004  devel  Fixed segfault issue with too-large packets inside 
                     pcapsource.  As far as I can tell this can only be 
                     generated by a flawed driver so it shouldn't be a 
                     security issue.  Root is dropped for pcapfiles so this
                     should be safe from that angle, too.
May 13 2004  devel  See, I haven't abandoned you all, just been really busy
                    Kluged out compile errors on some vendor-modified kernels
                     that include ethtool.h in wireless.h
                    Updated config file version and took out defunct examples
                    Fixed the rest of the compile errors on some kernels, 
                     with luck
Apr 22 2004  devel  Fixed initial-channel -I arg for single named sources

                      Additional FreeBSD support and compile-time fixes
                      Better error reporting for most fatal conditions

                       and stop using this)
                      Fixed pcap on platforms like OSX, should compile 
                       cleanly out of the box

                      Added unmonitor support for more sources
                      Fixed sound playing on many drivers
                      Added optional fourth option to source= configfile 
                       lines to set initial channels
                      Modified monitor-entry IOCTLs to agree with more 
                       drivers
                      Added support for signal levels in dBm
                      Changed release numbering to YYYY-MM-Relnum to make 
                       people happy
                    Also there have been a LOT of gpsmap updates:
                      Binary caching of parsed XML for reduced processing 
                       time on repeated mappings of the same data
                      Rewritten power interpolation that actually works right

                      Proper handling of signal and noise levels in dBm
                      Feathered range circle drawing mode (translucent fading 
                       edges to range estimations)
                      Feathered scatterplot drawing (Very very slow however)
                      Background map color saturation control (Desaturation 
                       percentage control instead of pure greyscale)
                      Background map intensity control (Overlay map 
                       translucently over white or black)
                      Revamped and extended network labeling support
                      Revamped network center averaging code to sift the most 
                       relevant center points and average them
                      Moved to GMP for some math ops for extra precision
                      Fixed Mapblast support
                      Earthamap map source support
                      Null map source (blank screen)
                      Terraserver topographic map source
                      Terraserver autoscale support
                      Added gpsxml-sanitize command to clean XML files 
                       outside of gpsmap
                      Gobs of bugfixes.
Apr 07 2004  devel  Set gpsmap caching to save empty files
Apr 06 2004  devel  Fixed ACX100 FCS bytes
Apr 05 2004  devel  Fixed packet count bug in csv
Apr 04 2004  devel  Merged patch from Jamie for channel dwelling (multisecond
                     channel hopping)
Apr 02 2004  devel  Fixed bug in gpsmap cache that assigned the same id to all
                     points, eating an entire file if any points were filtered.
                    Code cleanup - Fixed several -pedantic warnings in gpsmap
                    Various other -pedantic cleanups
                    Flagged networks as dirty after a sort op to force a 
                     resort even when disconnected
                    Made gpsmap cache creation errors nonfatal
Mar 31 2004  devel  Fixed gpsmap cache error reporting mistake
                    Changed 'best signal' and 'best noise' stuff to handle dBm
                    Fixed signal recording for wext
                    Changed text in panel signal window slightly
                    Fixed gpsmap to count actual valid samples instead of all
                     samples in a file when determining if any samples were
                     collected
                    Added --color-saturation and --map-intensity to gpsmap to
                     change the greyscale desaturation and overall intensity
                     of the background map image.
Mar 30 2004  devel  Tentative support for calculating SNR from signal levels
                     in dBm for Kismet and gpsmap
Mar 29 2004  devel  Removed size restriction testing for now, let the remote
                     mapsource blow up if we're not a valid size.
                    Put scale ranges into --help
                    Fixed error in tcpclient reading new major/minors
                    Added Null mapsource for blank background to gpsmap
Mar 27 2004  devel  Fixed Mapblast map source in GPSMap, left Earthamap as the
                     default however.  (Thanks, poptix!)
                    Fixed mapblast user-scale
Mar 26 2004  devel  Added feathered scatter plot drawing to gpsmap.  This is
                     VERY slow but produces some nice effects in combination
                     with channel coloring to show saturation in an area.
                    Tweaked feather circle center drawing
Mar 25 2004  devel  Added binary caching to gpsmap, this more than doubles
                     the speed of gpsmap when repeatedly processing the same
                     sets of XML data.
Mar 23 2004  devel  Tweaked gpsmap channel color allocation
                    Tweaked legend drawing to scale to US 11 channels if
                     there are no networks on higher channels.  This makes
                     the legend look much nicer.
Mar 22 2004  devel  Added --feather-range to gpsmap to blur network range
                     circles into invisibility.  Imagemagick is very very
                     poorly documented.
                    Fixed various other bugs in gpsmap
                    Fixed various bugs with feathering and some data sets
Mar 21 2004  devel  Additional tweaks to prism54 avs monitoring

                    Merged patch from Antonio Eugenio Burriel to enable AVS 
                     headers on current prism54 drivers
                    Merged patch from Scott Taylor for translucent bounding
                     rects in gpsmap
                    Merged another patch from Scott for using terraserver
                     topo maps
Mar 19 2004  devel  Merged earthamap map source support from Ryan Maple
                    Added autoscale map selection to Earthamap and Terraserver
                    Marked Mapblast and Mappoint sources as defunct
                    Added earthamap script to makefile and cvs
                    Removed 'total' networks from legend, left 'visible'.
                     Total didn't make much sense.
                    New gpsmap labeling method, labels now drawn in the order
                     given, added new labels, bssid, ssid, manuf, info,
                     location
                    Tweaked labeling
Mar 18 2004  devel  Fixed expat error
Mar 17 2004  devel  Tweaked gpsmap to error out on no sample points
                    Fixed error string typo in get_ssid
                    Changed monitor mode controls to not nuke most SSIDs since
                     drivers don't seem to mind anymore, also updated prism54
                     and fixed a compile warning on acx100
                    Tweaked configure/makefiles to not allow 'make gpsmap' if
                     it wasn't enabled by configure
Mar 16 2004  devel  Tweaked acx100 source to match acx's new orinoco-esque
                     method
Mar 15 2004  devel  Finished gpsxml-sanitize, util takes a xml files and prints
                     the valid points back to stdout.
                    Fixed sending a removed network as a NETWORK statement
                     during the initial NETWORK enable seed
Mar 14 2004  devel  Split gpsmap sample manipulation voodoo off into its own
                     file for other utils to tie into
                    Started adding extras/ util to sanitize XML files for other
                     programs to use
Mar 13 2004  devel  Updated readme, added client column lists
                    Added unmonitor support for madwifi
                    Added switch to gpsmap to use old pure-average network 
                     center finding code
                    Moved fifodump out of logging, fifo will still happen with
                     '-n' now
                    Added fourth optional parameter to source= config lines to
                     set the initial channel
                    Updated spec file
Mar 12 2004  devel  Changed sound exec to dup2 /dev/null instead of closing
                     stdout and stderr, should prevent sox being mad about
                     not having output paths
Mar 11 2004  devel  Made blanking SSID during entering monitor mode a nonfatal
                     condition.  Should alleviate difficulties with some
                     drivers (prism54, maybe cisco)
                    Added large-file checking and defines, should overcome the
                     2GB file size limit on systems that support it
                    Changed versioning (again) - YYYY-MM-Release.
Mar 10 2004  devel  Fixed a segfault in the client command protocol
                    Improved error reporting for madwifi monitor mode
Mar 08 2004  devel  Fixed a segfault with a 0-length macaddr struct (exposed
                     by an empty manuf map file).  No security implications.
                    Changed ifdef block in pcapsource, added ifndef to 
                     compensate for pcap on some platforms
Mar 07 2004  devel  Fixed another bsd compile error
                    Revamped error reporting to print errors to console even
                     when silent if there are no clients.  Should force showing
                     fast-startup errors that got hidden before.
Mar 04 2004  devel  Fixed undefined function error on BSDs introduced from
                     other error catching
                    Fixed stupid config test copy and paste bug for GMP
                    Reordered orinoco monitor commands
                    More major gpsmap updates
                     Total rewrite of interpolation.  Previous code was 
                      terminally broken.  New interpolation algos are MUCH
                      more adept at handling "generic wardriving" data.
                     Moved interpolation to only process "relevant center"
                      (see previous gpsmap update) instead of every point
                     Fixed legend drawing when using default network colors
                      and doing power interpolation
                    Tweaked orinoco channel control - should eliminate errors
                     seen with some older drivers and -devel
Mar 03 2004  devel  Rewrote gpsmap network-center guessing to find groups of
                     sample points and use those
                    Started rewriting gpsmap to use GMP for math.  GMP is
                     now required.
                    Added support for ADMTek cards
Mar 01 2004  devel  Tweaked error reporting to client.
                    Fixed wtapfile support for new ethereal wiretap versions
                    Merged ifdefs from Thomas Dettbarn to fix compiling on 
                     some freebsd systems
Feb 28 2004  devel  Changed wtaplocaldump code to have better drive-ful error
                     messages
Feb 26 2004  devel  Smart determination of channel controls on new orinoco
                     drivers, correct exiting of rfmon on new orinoco drivers
                    Added new orinoco capture source orinoco_14 to handle the
                     changes in the new orinoco 0.14 cvs tree
Feb 25 2004  devel  Fixed expat parsing the new kismet version strings
Feb 24 2004  devel  Fixed prism2_legacy (wow, someone still uses this) to trim
                     the FCS off the frames correctly, and to mute the wlanctl
                     commands
                    Added more intelligent error messages for the interface
                     going away in the middle of a capture.
Feb 22 2004  devel  Merged FreeBSD patch from Sam (with some changes):
                     * Renamed to radiotap_fbsd_X (me.  radiotap_freebsd_x was
                       just getting kind of silly to type.)
                     * Split source into ab/a/b, like MadWifi
                     * Trimmed out redundant/unused FetchChannel()
                     * Workaround for varargs for legible error messages
                     * Save and restore interface settings

                     part of the existing orinoco source
                    Merged patch from Deker to fix inverse bssid filtering
                    Tweaked wext header finding, added big warning
Feb 13 2004  devel  Reordered stuff in configure for some distros being cranky
Feb 10 2004  devel  Fixed 2 socket closure bugs, neither of which should have
                     any real world effect (both fatal conditions anyhow)
Feb 09 2004  devel  New devel cylcle started
                    Added check of new makefile.in and configure to makefile
Feb 09 2004 Feb0401 Released successor to 3.x with new versioning scheme. Enjoy
                     the new stable release, hopefully beginning a more monthly
                     release schedule.  Everyone should upgrade to this release
                     and don't forget to look at the readme for changes in card
                     source name.  New toys in this release:
                     * Rewritten packet engine, tens of times faster than 3.x,
                       migrated monitor mode and channel change to ioctl calls
                       for greater speed and efficiency

                     * Unmonitor support
                     * Improved error handling and return codes
                     * Vastly improved gpsmap data filtering
                     * Gpsmap legend drawing, bugs in multiple gpsxml file
                       parsing, allocation bugs, 
                     * Much improved packet dissection and validation, 
                       duplicate IV detection
                     * Countless other bug fixes to protocol consistency, 
                       OSX support, variable initialization, CSV output, and
                       more.
Feb 09 2004  devel  Changed major-minor-tiny designation to new versioning
                     scheme, Month-Year-Release# to match the new versioning
                     scheme.  *KISMET protocol now carries 'newversion' field,
                     everyone writing their own clients should update to this.

                     OpenBSD
                    Changed framework of unmonitor support.  This breaks some 
                     things right now, this sync only temporary.  Expect a 
                     fully fixed devel sync later this afternoon.

                    Added smarter output on termination, tied to unmonitor
                    Removed zeroing IPs from interfaces going into rfmon.  This
                     places the onus on the drivers to Do The Right Thing, but
                     makes my life a lot easier for restoring card states.

                     sources
                    Added smarter channel hopping setup, added server hopping
                     status to KISMET protocol

                    Added a dirty flag to tcpclient networks listing to save
                     on CPU usage when the network list isn't actually changing
                    Improved use of the dirty flag to conserve cpu

                     restoring card details on sources that support it
                    Merged patch from Pedro for more OpenBSD stuff
                    Merged patch from Sam for more radiotap support on freebsd.
                     Pending a patch to the MadWifi drivers, this should bring
                     functional support for FreeBSD.
Jan 26 2004  3.1.0  Fixed FCS byte trimming for MadWifi, this should fix Kismet
                     discarding most packets as invalid (Thanks, Anton)
                    Fixed monitor_wext not setting the initial channel if the
                     card is already in monitor mode (Thanks, Anton)
                    Merged additional patches from Sam for FreeBSD/Radiotap
Jan 25 2004  3.1.0  Long-asked for, the panels client is now able to lock
                     onto the channel of a selected network and stop 
                     hopping.  'L' to lock, 'H' to hop.  Currently only works
                     with a single capture source, multisource support to 
                     follow soon.

                     hopping
                    Fixed probe and data autogroups from being created for
                     only a single network (broken by yesterdays fix.)
                    Added intro window to panels client for new users, this
                     can be turned off by editing the ui config and putting
                     'showintro=false'
                    Added 'trackprobenets' config option to turn off following
                     probe responses and tracking probenets.
                    Merged patch from Anton fixing issues with scrolling the 
                     list of servers
Jan 21 2004  3.1.0  Fixed embarassingly stupid bug in panels probe/data

                    Removed debug printing on corrupt dronesource packets
                    Made probed networks clients of themselves
                    Minor speed update to packet tracking
                    Added setgid to setuid privdropping, leaving us as gid0 is
                     also bad.
Jan 17 2004  3.1.0  Tweaked empty SSID assignment (again)

                     frames now intercepted, data frames still problematic.
                    Merged gpsmap patches from Andrew Knutsen to add labeling
                     of manufacturer and beacon info, avoid overlapping network
                     labels, and scripts in the extras directory to generate
                     multiple maps of an area and to merge the IEEE 
                     manufacturer list into the Kismet manuf file.

                     new wepped networks
Jan 07 2004  3.1.0  Fixed more wep keysize bugs
Jan 04 2004  3.1.0  Changed probe network autogrouping to not group when there
                     is only 1 probe network
Jan 03 2004  3.1.0  Fixed nullproberesp alert

                    Significant speed boosts to gpsmap filtering
                    Changed algo.h sort() calls to stable_sort(). This seems
                     to be a bug in some gcc versions that causes segfaults.
                    Moved most of gpsmaps messages into the 'verbose' setting
