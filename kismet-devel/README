* What is it?
  Kismet is a 802.11b wireless network sniffer.  It is capable of sniffing 
  using almost any wireless card supported in Linux, including Prism2
  based cards supported by the Wlan-NG project (Linksys, Dlink, Rangelan,
  etc), cards which support standard packet capture via libpcap (Cisco),
  and limited support for cards without RF Monitor support.

* Features
  Multiple packet capture sources
  Runtime network sorting by AP MAC address (bssid)
  IP block detection
  Cisco product detection via CDP
  Ethereal and tcpdump compatable file logging
  Airsnort-compatable "interesting" (cryptographically weak) logging
  Secure SUID behavior
  Cloaked network detection
  Grouping and custom naming of SSIDs
  Multiple clients viewing a single capture stream
  Graphical mapping of data (gpsmap)
  Cross-platform support (handheld linux and BSD)
  Manufacturer identification
  Default factory setup detection 

* Quick start
  All of this will make more sense if you read the docs for each segment.
  1. Compile and Install Kismet
  2. Configure kismet.conf and kismet_ui.conf for your card and setup.
  3. Run kismet_monitor to enable rfmon mode, optionally with the 
     channel hopper.
  4. Run kismet.
