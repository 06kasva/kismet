*** THIS CODE IS CURRENTLY NOT COMPLETE ***

Unless you're in contact with me and are helping develop it, it's not likely
to do what you want.  What it CAN do, currently:

* Drive the AVR RAVEN
* Read pcap files
* Print debug info about packets
* Log to PCAP file
* Do basic 802.15.4 decoding

1.  What is Kismet-Dot15d4

    Kismet-Dot15d4 is a Kismet plugin which provides 802.15.4 support in
    Kismet.  802.15.4 is a low-power network protocol for sensors, control,
    and other "mote" applications, and is the underpinning of Zigbee, 6pan,
    etc.

    Driver support is included for the AVR USB RAVEN board, available here:
    http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=ATAVRRZUSBSTICK-ND

    It CAN NOT BE USED with 802.11 wi-fi cards, it is a completely different
    protocol.

    Kismet-Dot15d4 defines the decoders, loggers, and UI controls for
    802.15.4 networks in a common fashion, and supports reading and writing
    IEEE802.15.4 pcap files.

2.  Caveats

    This code is currently only partially developed and may not provide full
    functionality.

    This code implements a user-space driver using libusb.  Sometimes things
    go stupid and cause a sync issue and the server falls down.

    This code has only been tested on Linux.  Libusb works on other
    platforms, this code MAY work on other platforms, but currently it is
    only developed with Linux as a target.

3.  Compiling

	Compiling the Kismet-Dot15d4 plugin requires the Kismet source be installed
	and configured.

	By default, Kismet-Dot15d4 expects the Kismet source to be in
	/usr/src/kismet; this can be overridden by setting the
	KIS_SRC_DIR environment variable:

		cd plugin-dot15d4/
		KIS_SRC_DIR=/home/foo/src/kismet make

4.  Installing

	Kismet plugins may be installed system-wide in the plugins directory (by
	default, /usr/local/lib/kismet/) or in the users home directory
	(~/.kismet/plugins)

    The default installation path can be overridden with the KIS_DEST_DIR
    variable if you have not installed Kismet in the default location and
    wish to install the plugin in the system-wide plugins directory:
        cd plugin-ptw
        KIS_DEST_DIR=/usr make install

    Plugins can be installed in the current users home directory with:
        cd plugin-ptw
        make userinstall

5.  Using

    Once the plugin is loaded, Kismet will automatically understand and
    decode pcap files with the IEEE802.15.4 link data.

    To capture from an AVR RAVEN, plug in the USB device, and define a
    capture source in Kismet using the interface 'raven'.  The device will
    be automatically detected.

    To monitor with multiple Raven devices at once, each raven must have a
    USB device ID specified with the 'usbdev' source option.  The definition
    of the usb device ID depends on the operating system, in Linux it is a
    number incremented for each device and shown in 'lsusb' and 'dmesg'

    To enable pcap logging, the logfile must be turned on by adding
    'pcap15d4' to the logtypes= line of the kismet.conf.
