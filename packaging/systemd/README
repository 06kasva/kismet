Kismet Service (and Debug Service)

# Purpose

    The Kismet service runs Kismet, via systemd.  For running Kismet under full debug mode
    (for helping with development or tracking down errors), see the README in the
    kismet_debug/ directory.

# Installing

    To install Kismet as a systemd servie you'll need to copy one file:

        $ sudo cp kismet.service /etc/systemd/system/

    If you have installed Kismet to a different prefix, such as /usr, you'll need
    to adjust the paths accordingly.  You will need to adjust the path in
    kismet.service as well.

# Activating

    To start Kismet via systemd:

        $ sudo service kismet start

    To start Kismet by default on boot:

        $ sudo systemctl enable kismet
