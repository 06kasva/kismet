                    Fixed per-network decay rates
Jul 09 2002  2.3    Exchanged 'tempfile' for 'mktemp' since some distros dont
                     have it.  (Thanks alex)
                    Fixed default config to have 'cardtype' instead of 'card'
Jul 08 2002  2.3    Rewrote all of the docs to bring them up to speed
                    Fixed segfaulting bug in panels frontend if there were no
                     network (caught by Darren)
                    Merged patches from Darren to handle control chars in SSIDs
                     better and to detect IPs from TCP.
                     ** Make sure to remove your ~/.kismet/ip_map file and 
                     let it be regenerated. **

                    Added "cardtype=" configfile option.  SET THIS!
                    Phased out "unmonitor" scripts.  They almost never worked.
                     Reset your PCMCIA instead.
                    Merged *_monitor into kismet_monitor to handle all cards
                    Rewrote monitor command line opts, added ability for
                     monitor to launch hopper automatically.
                    Rewrote prism2hopper into kismet_hopper which handles
                     orinoco cards as well now.
                    Changed 'kismet' to use /bin/sh
                    Added detection of kismet_hopper still running
                    Removed bash-specifics from 'kismet' script.
                    Added more manuf. info and IP ranges
                    Added user-control-kill file for kismet_hopper so 'kismet'
                     script can terminate it.
                    Fixed longstanding bug with factory IP assignment.  I don't
                     know how it persisted this long.
                    Fixed text window line length bug
                    Squished very long-standing bug which caused the network
                     list to be shortened by 1 during autosort and which caused
                     the network scroll to be offset sometimes.
                    Fixed bug in tcpclient that made it not detect the server
                     had halted.  Changed text in panels to show 'Discon'
                     instead of 'Elapsed' if the server has disconnected.
                    Fixed 'paused' not being displayed on string dump

Jul 05 2002  2.3    Reporting of unknown datalink types in pcapsource
                    Added color support to panels UI (check kismet_ui.conf).
                     Docs to come soon.
Jul 04 2002  2.3    Changed next/prev network keys in network details to 
                     'n' and 'p' since + and - are used for scrolling 
                     elsewhere
                    Actually fixed -u on kismet_curses this time
Jul 03 2002  2.3    Fixed some spelling errors in configure (Thanks erik)
                    Fixed segfault-on-exit of GPSMap (finally!)
                    Confirmed that gpsmap works with ImageMagick 5.4.7
                    gpsmap now looks for a network.xml.gz file if a specified
                     network.xml can't be found and zlib is enabled.
                    Added handling of BSD pcap headers
                    Tweaked configure to disable ethereal support instead of
                     stopping if glib isn't found.
Jul 02 2002  2.3    Added configure test for group 'man'
                    Applied another major patch from Ian:
                     Cleaned up caplen/len stuff in packetsources
                     Re-enabled nonblocking socket mode
                     Enabled max-depth of client queue in server
                     Handle EAGAIN/EINTR signals in server
                    Fleshed out popup-help
                    Cleaned up wtaplocaldump len/caplen usage
                    Added error catcher to pcapsource for setting nonblock
                    Re-enabled compiler optimization (-O2.  Why did this get
                     turned off?)
                    Fixed configure script to detect BSD correctly
                    Fixed -u parameter to kismet_curses
                    Restored libz support to gpsmap and expat parsers

                     No support from panels UI yet (soon)
                    Applied client->server communications patch from Ian
                     Major changes to the client/server arch
                     Client commands to server, socket fixes, server queuing.
                     Server source pausing (not supported by panels client
                     at the moment).
                    Applied gethostbyname patch from Ian (I never used the
                     hostname and it caused problems, so I just took it out.) 
                    Completely rewrote windowing internals of panel_source.
                     Added support for multiple popups, context help for each
                     popup, and general massive code cleanups in windowing code.
Jun 30 2002  2.3    Fixed minor off-by-4 error in prism2source (thanks Ian)
Jun 29 2002  2.3    Fixed gpsmap to handle old XML files with the first/last
                     gps coordinates.
                    Rolled in prism2hopper change from Stefan Schlott to allow
                     custom channel orders for hopping
                    Rewrote weak packet dumping to be compatable with modern
                     airsnort versions
                    Scaled GPS speeds to feet/sec and meters/sec when under 
                     0.5 miles/hr or kilometers/hr
Jun 28 2002  2.3    Fixed gpsmap doing bad things with interpolation if tracks
                     were turned off
                    Tweaked interpolation code, should make some more realistic
                     results.
                    Updated gpsmap man page
                    Rolled in gpsmap change to add user scaling independent of
                     user map centering (-S).  (Thanks bob@internetbob.com)
Jun 27 2002  2.3    Fixed really stupid error in no-beacon-logging.  Now it
                     actually works.
                    Made configuration inconsistencies a lot more forgiving
                     (gps support not added won't kill us if we ask for gps,
                     for instance.)
Jun 26 2002  2.3    Added 'beaconlog' config option to turn off logging of
                     beacon packets to the datafile
                    Added 'compresslogs' config option to compress the logs if
                     we have libz (as yet unsupported)
Jun 25 2002  2.3    Finished kismet2xml - -n network file option to link the
                     network XML file added.  Fixed ending of gps-run tag.
                    Bugfix to time output in gps xml
Jun 24 2002  2.3    Worked on context help - panelfront help system very broken
                     right now.
                    Wrote kismet2xml in the extras/ directory.  Converts binary
                     to XML.  You'll have to manually add the network file
                     reference for now.
Jun 21 2002  2.3    Fixed pcap prismheader code.  Helps to read from the right
                     variable.
                    Updated prism2 and pcap docs.
                    Flagged use of the prism2 driver as deprecated
                    Tweaked periodic write messages
                    Worked on man pages more, added to install.
                    Sanitize values going into CSV and XML to keep < > ; & from
                     killing us.
Jun 20 2002  2.3    Slow week.  Sorry.
                    Started adding support for drivers that prepend additional
                     data to the pcap packets (wlanng in some modes, and BSD
                     hermes)
                    pcapsource supports wlan-ng extra data (prismheader=true
                     on wlanctl-ng) for quality reporting in pcap mode.
                    Trap EN10MB link type (non monitor mode)
Jun 16 2002  2.3    Fixed minor bug in expat part of gpsmap re: multiple files
                    Tweaked status output for detecting new networks
                    Fixed IP range defaults bug
                    Worked on man pages
Jun 15 2002  2.3    Added default IP range to manufacturer fingerprints.
                     I STILL NEED MORE DETAILED MANUFACTURER DATA, please
                     send me any default configuration information you can
                     get.
                    Minor changes to kismet_server, kismet_curses --help
                    Wrote man page for kismet, kismet_curses, kismet_server
Jun 13 2002  2.3    Hacked at gpsmap more.
                    Changed default AP from 'V' to 'F' (F)actory default
                    Added '-L ssid,bssid' to label network points in gpsmap
Jun 11 2002  2.3    Philly wasn't all that good.
                    Bugfixes to gpsmap.
Jun 10 2002  2.3    More work on gpsmap supporting xml.
                    gpsmap now works with XML (woo, that took way too long).
                     fix for segfault at termination coming soon, as well as
                     new features available via gpsmap reading the network xml
                     files too.  Zlib support will be re-introduced ASAP.
                    Fixed majors problems in the new gpsmap code.
                    Added wep-based coloring of networks

                    Fixed writing glitch in gps xml
                    Stopped trying to extract strings from WEP-encrypted
                     packets. (Eliminates much of the junk data in the strings
                     dump)
                    Fixed bug in adhoc probe req handling (hopefully)
                    Fixed bug in group IP merging
Jun 06 2002  2.3    XML parser is done, pending integration with gpsmap.
                    More gpsmap work.
                    Tracked down another file-related segfault and made it
                     go away (thanks Dave)
Jun 05 2002  2.3    Fixed XML error in gps-dump xml output
                    Kismet was on Screensavers on TechTV.  Cool.
                    Tweaked gps DTD.
Jun 04 2002  2.3    Fixed segfault for generic capture, fixed several other
                     potential bugs in kismet_server regarding signed-ness
                     (thanks Francois)
                    Tweaked panel scrolling code, hopefully this will fix some
                     of the problems with scrolling networks (thanks again
                     Francois for a point in the right direction).
                    Worked more on expat parser, no, gpsmap doesn't work again
                     yet.
                    Finished network XML expat parser.  gpsmap still doesn't 
                     work but it's almost there.  gps xml parser is next.
                    Added expat to configure script
                    Fixed missing ; in csv output (thanks dave)
Jun 03 2002  2.3    Fixed %/ in default kismet config for gpsdrive waypoints.
Jun 02 2002  2.3    Fixed segfault with waypoint writing
                    Fixed segfaults with new logfiletypes.
                    Started expat XML parser to load network and gps files into
                     gpsmap
                    Added packtype=unknown to gpsdump ignore list
Jun 01 2002  2.3    Changed to XML-format GPS logging
                    Merged patch from Faust to optomize convex hull mapping
                    Rewrote logfile handling to be more efficient
                    Completely broke gpsmap until XML importer is written
                    Merged patch from Magnus to write gpsdrive waypoints
May 30 2002  2.3    Fixed bug that caused GPS ranges to be printed when there
                     was no valid GPS data.
May 29 2002  2.3    Added persistant IP range detection (like cloaked SSIDs,
                     once an IP range is found it will be remembered).
                    Added periodic saving of datafiles, controlled by the 
                     writeinterval config file option.  Leave this out or set
                     it to zero if you don't want to write all the data files
                     until quit time.
May 28 2002  2.3    Added default Zaurus configs to Zaurus ipk build process.
May 27 2002  2.3    Fixed (potentially) exploitable hole (local only). 
                    Fixed remote-exploitable hole (ack!) with specially crafted
                     SSID's and Festival speech output.
                    Fixed lack of newline in tcpclient.cc
May 26 2002  2.3    Fixed all sorts of bugs in MAC filtering (they were ignored
                     but still logged in the dumpfile and in the gpslogs, which
                     leads to interesting, but bad, drawing patterns.)
                    Rolled in network-convex-hulling gpsmap patch from Faust
                     (gpsmap -H)
                    Added filter and inverse filter BSSID to gpsmap (-F, -I)
                    Added configfile support to gpsmap (to read MAC filter
                     lists.)  It will continue to work without a configfile
                     as well.
                    Added popup window catch for fixed sizes > screen
May 25 2002  2.3    Tweaked gpsdump DTD
May 24 2002  2.3    Merged gpsmap patch from Faust, scatterplot of sample
                     points (should make a few people happy)
May 23 2002  2.3    Actually fixed association of probe req counting
                    Merged another gpsmap patch from Faust.  Beginnings of
                     convex hull, numerous fixes to my code.
                    Fixed minor error in network DTD
                    Started GPS dtd
                    Added more manuf fingerprints
May 22 2002  2.3    Fixed association of probe req network & number of total
                     networks.
May 21 2002  2.3    Some code cleanup in the panels drawing
                    Added max packet rate to statistics popup
                    Prettied statistics popup more
                    Started framework for per-channel signal power
                    Fixed weirdness with level rate reporting
May 20 2002  2.3    Added statistics popup
                    Added more manufacturer ID's

                    Added Apple manufacturer ID
                    Un-broke gpsmap tracks

                     transmission of manuf and score*
                    Fixed Jason Luthers name in code comments for SSID uncloak

                    Added -M metric option to GPSMap
                    Added --enable-syspcap to use system pcap instead of

                     power displays.
                    Fixed geom_distance macro in gpsmap
                    Improved track drawing code in gpsmap to filter jumps in the
                     incoming track data - should eliminate the straight-line 
                     jumps into nowhere some tracks showed.

                     interpolation, zeroed power fields.
                    Moved interpolation threading to per-demand line 
                     interlacing instead of vertical chunks.
                    !! Major rewriting of interpolation, now an order of 
                     magnitude faster.

                     scrolling error.
                    More changes to scrolling logic to catch when probe 
                     networks are absorbed.
                    Moved kismet2cwgd to C++, it works now.
                    Fixed GPS code to report a 0 lock when GPS server link

May 05 2002  2.1    APM support in panels ui to display the battery status.
                     (Maybe Dan will shut up now, or get a better battery)
                    Updated documentation and default config files
May 04 2002  2.1    Fixed CPU-sucking spin in kismet_server when launched from
                     the kismet script instead of standalone.
                    Revamped frontend preferences passing to be better.
                    Reduced delay in kismet script

                    Tweaked column header output
                    Tweaked scrolling, should alleviate some weird problems
                     when scrolling while new networks are detected.
                    Added mute toggle to popup windows.

                    Tweaked info bar code to handle short windows gracefully
                    Added Airsnort 2.0's weak IV detection algorithm
                    Split kismet.conf into kismet.conf and kismet_ui.conf
                    Moved 'guifoo' options to 'foo'
                    Rolled libpcap into source package to guarantee correct
                     versions being used.
                    Updated docs to reflect config move
Apr 30 2002  2.1    Updated documentation, FAQ
Apr 28 2002  2.1    Moved kismet_curses client loop to a select()-based method.
                    Removed spin in tcpclient that sucked cycles and made the
                     UI less responsive.
Apr 27 2002  2.1    Fixed GPSMap to not unlink user-supplied maps
                    Fixed gpsmap args to accept -m
                    Fixed GPS handling since the select() changes had a bad
                     effect on it.
Apr 26 2002  2.1    Rolled in Magnus Ullberg's patch to gpsmap to handle custom
                     map sizes.
                    Added custom map file loading to gpsmap.
                    Un-broke important maps.  Yeah.  That was dumb.
Apr 25 2002  2.1    Migrated entire server base to select() based system.  This
                     should stop the 100 packets/s problem discussed on the 
                     mailing list (see mailing list archives for today)
                    Finished bugfixing SSID detection and munging to printable.
                     (Make sure to remove junk SSID's from ~/.kismet/ssid_map,
                      or just remove ssid_map entirely.)
Apr 24 2002  2.1    Fixed handling of unknown column names
                    Played with MungeToPrintable to behave less dumbly.
                    SSID's are now restricted to ascii ' ' to '~'.  (Do a man
                     ascii if this doesn't make sense to you.)
Apr 23 2002  2.1    Fixed potential segfaults and packet corruption in SSID
                     handler
                    SSID's are now munged to printable characters
Apr 22 2002  2.1    Fixed gpsmap bug involving networks with no accompanying
                     GPS records.

                     active when combining groups.
Apr 21 2002  2.1    Fixed segfault on corrupt BSSID (stupid off-by-one)
                    Fixed bug in panels interface printing total number of 
                     packets (a+b+a != a+b).
                    Added valid BSSID range checking
                    Improved probe request merging
                    Updated and typo-fixed some documentation.
                    Added more range handling to tcpclient to not shoot 
                     ourselves in the foot.
Apr 20 2002  2.1    Fixed ',' where ';' should have been in csv
Apr 19 2002  2.1    Added status-bar warnings that you cannot perform certian
                     actions when in autofit sort mode.
                    Improved probe request/probe response handling some more
                    Fixed divergent IP range calculations for groups
Apr 18 2002  2.1    Minor speedboosts to gpsmap track drawing on custom-sized
                     map.
                    Detect probe responses and merge probe req networks into
                     the owning network, once determined.
Apr 17 2002  2.1    Fixed minor bug in cloaked group name updates
                    Fixed bug in cloaked network detection re: non-beacon
                     first packets for a known network showing up as cloaked.
                    Expanded groups are now sorted
                    Fixed --columns == -c in kismet_curses

Apr 16 2002  2.0p1  Fixed panels group display that locked flag '4' on.
                    Documented ncurses and panels
                    Updated 'help' list for panels
                    Added "narrow" sort and help texts for handheld displays
                    Fixed local dumper configure output

                     Arm)
                    Fixed prism2/cisco scripts, AGAIN.  grr.
                    Redid website
                    Updated final bits of documentation after rereading them
                     during website conversion

                    Updated documentation, moved into docs/ directory.
                    Began writing developer documentation
                    Updated FAQ
                    Cleaned cruft out of packetracker source
                    Added MAC filtering to drop undesired packets.
                    Turned off verbose-by-default on GPSMap
                    Turned off legend option in GPSMap (Some day.  But usually
                     so many networks are graphed that it doesn't matter.)
                    Removed network color option in GPSMap (This will come back
                     some day.)
                    Added user-specified network center and scale to GPSMap
                    Changed Makefile to listen to the prefix and bin/etc paths
                     when making ipkg's.
                    Fixed bug in prism2_monitor and _unmonitor scripts.
                    Calling this 2.0pre1.  2.0 "Real soon now"
                    Added gpsmap to installed software
                    Tweaked imagemagick detection to find it more successfully.
                    Tweaked Makefile to print out all the files it's installing
                     (cosmetic fix only)
                    Fixed libz inclusion (this will make Zaurus users happier)
                    Fixed imagemagick detection when crosscompiling
                    Fixed ipkg generation
                    Added ``buzzme'' for Zaurus-enabled compiles/installs/ipkgs
                    Rolled in string-dump clearing patch by Dave (Caesium)
Apr 14 2002  1.5    Groups save now.  ~/.kismet/group_map.  Should be a very
                     easy format for anyone writing other UI's to use.
                    Tweaked tcpclient.cc (Faust)
                    Fixed panelfront to use name under shortname.
                    Tweaked grouping not to make 1-node groups.
Apr 13 2002  1.5    Added IP aggregation for groups.
                    Fixed bug in logfile path explosion
                    Added %h - home directory - to path explosion
                    Fixed bug in cisco tcp pushing
                    Fixed potential bug in new network tcp pushing
                    Added confdir directive to store state stuff that gets
                     written
                    Added ssid_map state file.  This maps all the SSID's 
                     discovered - once you find the SSID of a cloaked network
                     Kismet will always know about it now!
Apr 12 2002  1.5    Fixed DHCP address range detection.  Now logical-ands
                     the network mask the way it should be.
                    Fixed segfault if you tried to group w/out a tag.
                    Fixed bug in packetracker - how did this NOT segfault?
                     I'm confused.  Eh.  Whatever.  Now I know why it works.
                    Added BSSID "masking" in groups where the BSSID aggregate
                     is displayed up to divergence.
Apr 11 2002  1.5    Removed pageup/pagedown - there's no really clean way to
                     do them with grouping too.  Whine at me if you really
                     want them back and I'll consider it.
                    Removed pausing the network list - it was very counter-
                     intuitive and a pain to maintain anyhow.  Pausing is
                     still allowed in the string dump.
                    Added group expansion/collapsing
                    Added un-grouping
                    Tweaked group calculations for channel
                    Moved +/- from scroll up/down to expand/collapse of groups
                     I think this makes more sense, convince me if you don't
                     agree.
                    Restored network detailed info as group-friendly.
                    Fixed some glitches with the GPS segments of networks, 
                     (large random numbers in the coordinates and speeds when a
                     GPS was not hooked up)
                    Added XmitPower: 1 to cisco_monitor to try to tone down the
                     beacon transmit problem.
                    Group titling works now
Apr 10 2002  1.5    UI works again with groups skeleton
                    GROUPING WORKS but is not currently saved, loaded, etc.
                    Fixed numerous showstopping bugs in panels UI that just
                     hadn't reared their heads yet.  Several segfaults gone.
Apr 09 2002  1.5    Fixed kismet2cwgd to not call every network __TRACK__.
                     (thanks Magnus)
                    Turned off track-jump warnings in gpsmap
                    Completely broke panels UI adding groups.
Apr 08 2002  1.5    Added network sort info to the top of the network panel
                    Fixed bug in network sorting, but at least it was a 
                     consistent bug so it wasn't visible.
                    Moved group code into frontend.h and created frontend.cc
Apr 07 2002  1.5    Fixed adhoc double-counting and added adhoc_data packet
                    Fixed .network dump again, helps to fix it right the first
                     time.
                    Rewrote GPS tracking - now saves min/max coordinates and
                     speed.
                    Rewrote network dump for new GPS
                    Rewrote XML for new GPS, updated 1.2 DTD
                    Rewrote CSV for new GPS, updated SQL definition.
                    Added coordinates to network details in panel UI
                    Fixed bug in XML output that tied network ranges to GPS
                     presence.
                    Fixed bug in tcp client that obscured multiple STATUS
                     triggers in a single read loop
                    Cleaned old sorting cruft out of tcpclient
Apr 06 2002  1.5    Added --enable-zaurus to turn on extra zaurus features
                    Added imagemagick version detection to configure
                    Added runtime muting (Dan's a whiny bitch ;P )
                    Fixed network output bug
Apr 05 2002  1.5    Fixed configure -lpanel for arm-crosscompile not linking 
                     -l*curses during the test.
Apr 04 2002  1.5    Finished kismet2cwgd perl code to convert to a common 
                     GPS format.
                    Fixed kismet script refering to ncurses
Apr 03 2002  1.5    Added missing includes to configfile.cc on some 
                     compilers.
                    Started perl gps converter to common format
                    Fixed duplicate fields in CSV/SQL extra file.
Apr 02 2002  1.5    Fixed segfault in new power code & gpsdump.  Dereferencing
                     nulls is a Bad Thing.
                    Tweaked how power is logged to be not-broken.
                    Gave /proc/net/wireless power info back to the Generic
                     capture source.
                    Added --disable-gps configure option for handheld systems
                     with no possibility of GPS support (or no desire for GPS
                     support).  This trims about 20k off the server executeable.
                    Fixed power reporting client/server glitch
                    Moved ``ncurses'' gui to ``curses'', ncursefront* to 
                     cursesfront*, kismet_ncurses to kismet_curses, etc.
                    Added ability to disable curses UI and leave panels UI
                    Fixed stripping of binaries under ``make install''
Apr 01 2002  1.5    I hate April 1.
                    Wrote XML dtd 1.1 to incorporate ``type'' on each network.
                    Added network type to CSV output and updated example SQL
                    Added network type to .net output
                    Added prism2 packet-header power detection as discussed
                     on the mailing list.  Has not been well tested yet however
                    Recoded entire power-level detection scheme.
                    Fixed packet timestamps for some capture types.
Mar 31 2002  1.5    Fixed potential problems with GUI data string lengths.
                    Added string dump to list printable strings in data packets
                    Added dump window pausing
                    Fixed bug in the client socket code that didn't set the
                     socket to be nonblocking.
Mar 30 2002  1.5    Fiddled with how the client reads data to help prevent the
                     socket buffer getting full and breaking.
                    Tweaked the blank SSID detection to treat non-0 length
                     SSID's of all spaces as 'NO SSID' and to continue trying
                     to do cloak detection on them.
                    Improved 802.11 packet dissection to catch severely 
                     malformed packets.
                    Fixed ncurses detection glitch
                    !! autoconf is now cross-platform, --host=arm-linux works.
                    Tweaked noise packet sound conditions to favor data sound
                     over junk sound.
                    Added wireless-active test to configure to make crossbuild
                     work smoothly.
                    Moved default Ethereal source dir to 0.9.3.
Mar 29 2002  1.5    Tweaked beaconing detection code again
                    Tweaked XML and completed DTD.  XML output now validates.
                    Added pausing of the network display
                    Tested yesterdays GPS/segfaulting fix, it works.
                    Moved card power levels in panels interface to 'l' instead
                     of 'p'.
Mar 28 2002  1.5    Added ``extra'' directory with bits (XML and SQL 
                     definitions)
                    Finished panels resizing when windows resize.
                    Wrote XML exporter  (Fear not embedded fans, this doesn't
                     require any extra libs.  The DTD is in extra/ and at 
                     http://kismetwireless.net/kismet-1.0.dtd).
                    Found and stomped insidious little bug in the gpsd code
                     that would lead to a segfault under certian buffer
                     conditions.
                    Added better GPSD parsing.
                    Started framework for special argument parsing for 
                     kde/gtk frontends.
                    Fixed adhoc beaconing handling to be not-dumb.
Mar 26 2002  1.5    Removed packetracker.h include from gpsmap
                    Cleaned up a lot of creeping crud with config.h and various
                     files.  Should fix some compile problems on .96 and 3.0 
                     gcc versions.
                    Added README.bsd
                    Un-stupided packetracker.h including itself.  Damn fingers
                     doing their own autocomplete.
                    Fixed configure's handling of versiontiny of linux kernel
                     when combined with RH appending -whatever to the vers.
Mar 25 2002  1.5    Incorporated PF_SOCKET capture source patches from
                     Andreas Jellinghaus (much delayed) since I now have a 
                     copy of the pf_sock patches for wlan-ng.  This should
                     work with the APHost drivers as well as patched wlan-ng.
                    Added "pfsock" to config file
                    Removed incorrect config file comment about valid dump type
                    Removed PF_SOCKET capture stuff.  With the right patches 
                     this is done with pcap.  Read the prism2 readme for how
                     to make this work (summary:  apply the packet and promisc
                     patches from http://www.shaftnet.org/~pizza/software/ 
                     use prism2_monitor to enable sniffing and pcap capture 
                     mode.
                    Tweaked prism2 scripts to ifconfig it to promisc mode
                     to help with pf_sock/2.4.18
Mar 24 2002  1.5    Added Maxrate to the CSV output.
                    Added configuration printout at the end of autoconf
                    Fixed packet.h dumbness
Mar 23 2002  1.5    Tweaked dependencies in Makefile to accomodate BSD/gmake
                    Merged CSV (comma-seperated) output patch from
                     Reyk Floeter.
                    Moved kismet to scripts/kismet (it is a script afterall)
                    Added BSD ancontrol script, bsd_cisco_monitor.  Let me 
                     know if this doesn't work, it's untested.
                    Added #ifdef to gpsmap to prevent errors during make dep
                     when imagemagick isn't present.
                    Autodetect 'root' group, install as 'wheel' if not present
                    !! Confirmed compiling and successful running on OpenBSD!
                    Updated default ethereal path to 0.9.2
                    Unbashified Makefile if tests
                    Updated FAQ
Mar 22 2002  1.5    Started multi-host-type configure script changes. (on the
                     way to BSD support)
                    Added netlink detection to configure (and --disable-netlink)
                    Modified prism2_*monitor and cisco_*monitor to use /bin/sh
                     and to perform non-bash-centric 'if' statements
                    Removed 'killall prism2_hopper' from prism2_unmonitor. 
                     Non-linux systems have a very very different idea about 
                     what killall means and it's not likely to be what you 
                     want it to do.
                    prism2 source now respects linux netlink configure option
                    Added accept() parameter testing to work on BSD systems
                    Added getopt.h to the "fail if missing" list in configure
                    Fixed ncurses/curses interaction
                    Added FSF 'getopt.c' for non-libc-getopt systems (darwin,
                     most BSD's)
                    Added _("..") hack for systems without support for it.
                    Bugfixed panels stuff
                    !! We now compile (and concievably run, if you can get the
                     card into RFMon mode) on Mac OSX.  We should also compile on
                     BSD but as yet untested.
                    Un-stupided panel after mistyping the #ifdef.  Yeah.  I'm 
                     dumb.
                    Added stdint/inttypes autoconf detection for BSD
Mar 21 2002  1.5    (Cosmetic) cleaned up changelog to fit in 80 characters 
                    Bashed ncurses and panels around a bit to try to force them
                     to behave on some compilers.  Why the HELL did they define
                     things like ``erase()'' as a macro?  Completely screws STL.
                     Should compile on Slack 7.1 gcc again.
                    Un-stupided cisco_unmonitor script
                    Panels interface now rescales if the terminal size changes
Mar 20 2002  1.5    Tweaked make distclean
                    Fixed gpsmap stl error
                    Shuffled includes for panel.h to try to un-break 
                     compilation on some versions of gcc.
                    Fixed guisound_gps twice in default/sample config.
                    Tweaked kismet script (thanks kev)
                    Install wavs into $PREFIX/share/kismet/wav/foo (thanks kev)
                    Panel detailed info scrolling
                    Tweaked various other panels bits.  Bugfixes to all 
                     edge-position calculations.
Mar 19 2002  1.5    Panels work.
Mar 18 2002  1.5    Panels UI work.  Network Info begins to function.
Mar 17 2002  1.5    Further un-stupided the scripts
Mar 16 2002  1.5    Beacon interval detection
                    Rewrote fixed-header dissection
                    Added info, mask, gateway columns
                    Trimmed some cruft and old commented code out of various 
                     files.
                    Added max data rate detection
                    Added max rate column
                    Fixed pagedown scrolling
                    Un-broked cisco scripts.
                    Fixed default column to show "packets" instead of "data"
                    Re-enabled probe request display.
Mar 15 2002  1.5    Custom column order in panel UI (config support coming soon)
                    cisco_monitor and prism2_monitor scripts now pull the device
                     from kismet.conf.  --arm option removed from configure.  
                     (hey, it IS the devel tree!)
                    cisco_monitor, prism2_monitor, prism2_hopper all respect the
                     global config file ``capinterface='' option.  NOTE:  
                     CAPINTERFACE MUST BE SET CORRECTLY FOR PRISM2 CAPTURES NOW,
                     since it matters with this change.
                    Added custom column support to the config file.  Whee.
Mar 14 2002  1.5    Fixed long-standing configure bug where --enable-foo 
                     actually disabled it when enabled was the default.  Took 
                     out the --enable options altogether for the defaults, and 
                     left --disable.
                    Fixed prism2_unmonitor to use $device correctly.
                    Fixed prism2_hopper to not print stdout
                    Tweaked prism2_hopper to use popen instead of system -- 
                     should eat slightly fewer resources on small systems.
                    Fixed 'kismet' bash script to be more reliable about killing
                     off kismet_server
Mar 13 2002  1.5    Selected scrolling in panels is done.
Mar 12 2002  1.5    Fixed GPSv4.  Don't use yesterdays -devel.  Ever. 
                    Added newline to end of networksort.h (I hate gcc3)
                    Fixed scrolling
                    Worked more on generic source, but it's still highly 
                     unreliable. You should try the prism2-style monitoring 
                     patch for orinoco.
Mar 11 2002  1.5    Added user-directed scrolling to sorted netlist window
                    Added more sort types:
                     Auto          Channel       First seen
                     Last seen     BSSID         SSID
                     WEP           Packets
                    Cleaned up popup window code
                    Rewrote popup printer functions completely
                    Added wireless power stats popup window
                    Fixed GPS display
                    Added map support for the horrible GPSv3 format which 
                     accidentally crept into some -devel releases
                    Added GPSv4 logging and mapping (adds signal quality and 
                     power, as well as expands the maximum number of networks 
                     in 1 file to 4096, previously 256)
Mar 10 2002  1.5    Added panels help menu
                    Added custom sorting and lots of panel UI work, no sense 
                     listing every single little thing yet
Mar 09 2002  1.5    Started to un-break generic source but still needs testing.
                    Added broadcast warning to generic source
                    Added libwiretap wtap_read parameter checking to autoconf 
                     to handle different wiretap versions.
                    Rolled panel and ncurses into kismet_ncurses
                    Added autoconf option to disable panels 
                    Fixed ncurses display glitch on status
                    Fixed client display for network decay times and sniff 
                     duration
Mar 08 2002  1.5    GPSMap will fit the map to actual network data instead of 
                     track data if track drawing is disabled.
                    Recoded network export to only export new networks.  Should
                     fix the problem of the GUI not listing new networks beyond
                     a certian number.
                    Fixed kismet.conf default 'speed' type (should have been 
                     'speech')
                    Added GPS lock aquired and lost sound events
                    Fixed a bug in network and packet counting that would have 
                     caused problems with festival speech if sound was also 
                     enabled.
                    Fixed compile problem with prism2hopper
                    Worked on generic capture source more.  Broke it.
Mar 07 2002  1.5    Slow coding day, sorry.
                    Merged prism2_monitor and arm2_monitor, rejoined 
                     prism2_hopper and arm2_hopper.  Introduced configure option
                     --enable-arm to set specific options.
                    Tweaked prism2_hopper to use Frank's channel order and to 
                     support international channels (-i).
                    Eliminated shell call in prism2_hopper, now calls wlanctl 
                     directly.
Mar 06 2002  1.5    Cleaned up ARM build process
                     Added 'arm' makefile target to build arm stuff only
                     Copied prism2_hopper to arm2_hopper to call the 
                      arm2_monitor scripts automatically
                     Built new ipkg of the latest devel code with all 
                      accompanying fixes and improvements.
                    Fixed kismet_server never writing packet tracker status 
                     updates, even in talkative mode.
                    Started panels client
                    Put gui= back into config, kismet script now obeys it
                    Kismet script now has absolute paths based off the configure
                     values to the server and client binaries
                    Added std namespace and compliant stl header files (thanks 
                     Million!) This should fix some/all of the gcc3 issues.
                    Fixed gpsmap glitch that caused 'streaking' across the map.
                     I think ultimately this lies in ImageMagick, but I've 
                     eliminated the cause.
                    ImageMagick 5.4.3-11 appears to have the fixed circle code 
                     gpsmap needs.  
                    Changed map fetch url in gpsmap from mblast to myblast (per Stefan's 
                     suggestion).  This seems to make it work in Europe and the US.  Let 
                     me know if it suddenly breaks it for you.
                    Won't do power calculations if theres no power data in the gps file.
                    Added GPS Version 1 file support to gpsmap (and ignores data from v1 
                     files for interpolation)
                    Tweaked scaling some more to handle gargantuan scales (note:  mapblast
                     adds in a distortion on global-sized maps that makes the drawng... 
                     not work.)
Mar 05 2002  1.5    Fixed --draw-center-dot to accept size correctly
                    Set gpsmap default transparency to 70%, like it claims
                    Note: ImageMagick has a bug which may lead to a segfault when drawing 
                     network ranges.  A patch should be available soon.
                    Added 8% scale increase to extreme-scale maps to comepensate for range
                     drift in the distance math.
Mar 04 2002  1.5    Added center dot drawing to gpsmap
                    Added newlines to all source files to placate some compilers
                    Fixed ``make install'' dependencies to correctly compile all components
                    Added gzip'd GPS file support -- now you can gzip all your gps logfiles
                     to save space, and gpsmap will decompress them on the fly.  
                    Added <stdio.h> to wtaplocaldump.cc
                    Added kernel version test and warning to help screen out buggy older
                     kernels.
                    Added prism2_[un]monitor and cisco_[un]monitor to make install
Mar 03 2002  1.5    Fixed 'no logging' commmand line combined with no logs defined in 
                     config file error that no logs were defined.
                    Added CPPFLAGS to Makefile
                    Added '-f' to make clean rm's to prevent complaining about files.
                    Migrated all current gpsmap drawing modes to command-line arguments,
                     see gpsmap --help.
                    Moved 'kismet' to 'kismet_server' and added 'kismet' shell script to 
                     broker starting everything in sync.
Mar 02 2002  1.5    Fixed some distance calculations for power graphing
                    wireless@kismetwireless.net mailing list is up 
                     (wireless-subscribe@kismetwireless.net to sign up)
Mar 01 2002  1.5    Fixed (Finally!!) network sorting so it orders sanely.
                    Documented GPS Map
                    Updated FAQ
                    Fixed sound /dev/null output sink -- kismet displays sound errors but
                     kismet_ncurses does not.
                    Added resolution settings for power graph
                    Added time estimate for power graph
                    Fixed GPS speed calculations
                    Fixed logfile numbering to be consistent across a run (previously
                     if the dump was numbered 2, the gps could still be 1 if there wasn't
                     a gpslog 1 already.  This was annoying.)
                    Fixed uninitialized cloaked SSID variable that led to false-positive 
                     detection of cloaked networks.
                    Added Shaw Innis' Festival speech code to speak new networks
                    Added conversion readme to help explain the differences in the new 
                     TCP-based user interface setup.
                    Added Server version reporting to interface
                    Added connection reporting to server
Feb 28 2002  1.5    Fixed reference to gpslist in configure
                    Directed all soundplay output to /dev/null so prevent it from mungling
                     the GUI.
                    Added cisco detection to tcpclient
                    Added status push and detection to server and client
                    Added status update for cloaked detection
                    Added status update for SSID detection on former data network
                    Added a few newlines to the end of config.h to stop some compilers
                     from whining.
                    Added cloaked network denotation - <ssid> for formerly cloaked networks.
                    Added consistent run-time reporting to GUI
Feb 26 2002  1.5    Added various things to ``make depend''
                    Added cisco export to GUI
                    Added version/start time export to GUI
                    !! New website, www.kismetwireless.net ... Thanks Nome!
Feb 24 2002  1.5    Added config file support to ncurses GUI, added correct config file
                     support to kismet itself as far as allowed hosts and ports.
                    Added kismet-ncurses to the installed binaries.
                    Added IP filtering for UI serving 
Feb 23 2002  1.5    Added sound support to ncurses network GUI, fixed numerous bugs.
Feb 22 2002  1.5    Added increased error detection for gps sockets.  This should fix a 
                     segfault issue when connecting to broken gpsd's.
                    Changed #ifdef 0 to #ifdef DISABLED (staging area before I completely
                     remove a block of code) -- apparently some gcc versions don't like 
                     this.
Feb 21 2002  1.5    Added ncurses_kismet to ``make clean''
Feb 20 2002  1.5    First iteration of the new TCPIP-based GUI socket.  More to come soon.
                    Implemented GPS remote record
                    Implemented TIME remote record
                    Implemented NETWORK remote record
Feb 17 2002  1.5    Got mentioned in InfoWorld.  Cool
                    Added interpolated power graphing to gpslist, but it's still got a 
                     long way to go.
                    Fixed gpslist map sizing (again).
                    Added map greyscaling to gpslist
                    Added (rudimentary) imagemagick detection to configure script.
                    Added multiple-GPS-dump loading to gpslist
Feb 14 2002  1.5    Added signal power logging to the GPS trackfile

Feb 13 2002  1.4.1  !! 1.4.1 released with GPS logfile updates.

Feb 12 2002  1.5    Fixed bug in GPS logging and network updating.
Feb 12 2002  1.5    Moved prism2_[un]monitor to arm2_[un]monitor for arm packages, changed
                     wlan0 to eth0 in arm2_[un]monitor scripts since Zaurus' wlan-ng 
                     drivers map to eth0 instead of wlan0.
                    Added ``prism2_hopper'' prism2 channel hopper control program
                    Added ``killall prism2_hopper'' to prism2_monitor and prism2_unmonitor
                    Fixed stupidity with killall prism2_hopper (prism2_monitor ch nokill)
                    Added WEP disable to prism2_monitor
Feb 11 2002  1.5    Added logic to gpsdrive to find a MapQuest map of the right scale
                     to hold all the sample points. (gpslist)
                    Added ImageMagick support to draw translucent networks over 
                     downloaded maps (gpslist)
                    Added travel path drawing support (gpslist)
                    Fixed scaling/centering logic (gpslist)
Feb 10 2002  1.5    Tweaked gpslist code to average distance, speed, 
                     and alt.  Stole code from GPSDrive to convert lat/lon into
                     x and y pixel coordinates on a mapquest image, added logic
                     to find average center of a network.
Feb 09 2002  1.5    Tweaked DS packet handling slightly to do additional MAC 
                     matching.
                    Added Tag133 handling to extract "extra info" that Cisco (and 
                     maybe others) put at the end of their beacon packets.
                    Fixed range calculation for gpslist
Feb 08 2002  1.5    Added patch from Jason Luther to match probe responses with
                     "closed" networks that cloak the SSID until a probe is 
                     performed.  This should help clear up a lot of the "No SSID"
                     and blank SSID networks.
                    Fixed silly termination not calling gui->EndDisplay() bug caused
                     by the SIGHUP catcher.
                    Added prism2 scripts to kismet-arm branch.
                    ARM port verified to work.  New ARM binaries released.
                    Sharp Zaurus ipkg released.
Feb 05 2002  1.5    Added detection of pcap/pcap.h for some installations.
                    Added packet-source specific fuzzy encryption
                    Added min/max coordinate recording to gpslist
                    Added earth distance calculation to gpslist (Thanks Faust)
Feb 04 2002  1.5    Fixed --disable-wireless configure option
                    Added "make checkconfig" and config file versioning
                    Added "fuzzy" encryption detection (see the README
                     file for details.)
Feb 03 2002  1.5    Added SIGTERM catcher
                    Added --disable-wireless configure option
                    Added SIGHUP catcher
                    Dewalled wtaplocaldump (unsigned to signed comparison)

Feb 02 2002  1.5    ARM binaries released (Please test)

Feb 02 2002  1.5    Started test compiling for ARM platform
                    Added stdio.h includes where needed (errors if pcap and wtap 
                     both disabled)
                    Added ncurses frontend scaling to drop fields from the display
                     when on a small screen (primarily for ARM port)
                    Added default path to ethereal 0.9.1
                    Fixed --without-ethereal configure complaint
Feb 01 2002  1.5    Removed Probe Request tracking until a better means of doing
                     it is found.  This fixes the "split network" problem where
                     the data will be listed under "no ssid" and the LLC listed 
                     correctly.

Jan 29 2002  1.4    Kismet 1.4 released -- Happy linux world!
                    Main enhancements:
                     GPS Support
                     Repaired Prism/2 Support
                     AP->AP packet dissection (from_ds and to_ds = 1)
                     Improved packet dissection
                     Numerous bugfixes

Jan 29 2002  1.3    Improved 'gpslist' demo program
                    Tweaking network display sort algo
                    Updated/synced FAQ
                    Fixed SSID glitch when upgrading a data network to a full
                     network if the SSID field is empty.
                    Fixed channel glitch when upgrading a data network to a full
                     network -- upgraded data networks are now assigned the correct
                     channel.
                    Eliminated potentialy fatal error in CDP dissection (snprintf %s)
                    !! Recoded packet protocol detection/dissection - resolved 
                     numerous flaws and now supports ap->ap packets correctly.
                    Fixed segfault on wtapfile loading if the file did not exist.
                     *note* - wtapfile loading occurs AFTER a priv drop, so this should
                     not be a vulnerability.
                    Fixed crypt packet detection - Yikes, this one was REALLY broken,
                     did I just delete a line accidentally while editing tonight?
Jan 28 2002  1.3    Revamped log definitions in kismet.conf to match command 
                     line style of comma-seperated logtypes on a single line.
                    !! Config file change
                    Finished defining gps dump file type.  
                    Added GPS dumping
                    Included demo program to extract GPS dumps
Jan 26 2002  1.3    Fixed network dump to order by network detection (MUCH easier
                     to read now!)
                    Fixed ncurses GUI to trim network lists efficiently & moved
                     tracker internals to vectors
                    Updated documentation for flags, compiling, gps.
Jan 25 2002  1.3    Better error catching and reporting for prism2source
                    My own GPS finially came in the mail.
                    Fixed "make forceinstall"
                    Ignoring "ENOBUFS" error in prism2 capture.  This should 
                     eliminate the problem of Kismet terminating unexpectedly
                     during prism/2 captures.
Jan 24 2002  1.3    Added more GPS support, gps error handling, made GPS usable.
                     Thanks to Tomcat for the loan of the Etrex
                    Fixed "generic wireless" packetsource dependence on libpcap
                     in kismet.cc
                    Generic Wireless packetsource disables weak, dump, and cisco
                     logs, since they're unsupported with this data type.
                    Added generic suid-warning
Jan 23 2002  1.3    Completely revamped frontend and packet handler methods.  
                     Frontends are now modular to allow a future GTK frontend.
                    Tied GPS to PacketHandler and ncurses front end and added
                     config support.
                    !! Config file change
                    I couldn't have planned this better: "0x8058466 in main 
                      (argc=4, argv=0xbffff974) at kismet.cc:666"
                    !! First release of GPS-enabled Kismet.
Jan 22 2002  1.3    Changed pcapsource nonblocking hack to use pcap_fileno(), which 
                     I completely forgot existed and is a much better solution than
                     a partial struct cast
                    GPSD support but no ties to the frontend
                    Started converting frontend to a modular class
Jan 20 2002  1.3    Fixed version in statup status bar
                    !! Added generic linux-wireless packet source.  This supports,
                     (minimally) Wavelan and any other linux-wireless compatable
                     card, with or without RF Monitoring.  READ THE DOCS FOR 
                     THIS, it is NOT as full featured as the rest of the packet
                     engines by ANY stretch of the imagination.

Jan 19 2002  1.2.1  !! Release version 1.2.1

Jan 19 2002  1.2.1  Fixed include and casting error in pcapsource.cc nonblocking 
                    io "fake" for old pcap's (thanks pkcp)

Jan 19 2002  1.2    !! Release version 1.2

Jan 19 2002  1.2    Moved version number to 1.2
                    Completed autoconf support (default include in code now matches
                     --prefix, other cleanups)
                    Added local pcap-dumper to write dumpfiles in the absence of 
                     a functional wiretap (wiretap used if present, local dumper 
                     used if no wiretap is available.)
                    Updated documentation
                    Updated FAQ to synchronize with website.
                    Added (minimal) mixed-endian support.  This should only really 
                     affect the local dumper code.
                    !! Implemented Guy Harris' suggestion about how to force 
                     nonblocking IO on non-cvs libpcaps.  No more pcap-devel required!
                    Added configure option to override wiretap dumper and use local
                     dumper code.
                    Fixed stdio include deficiency when pcap and wiretap both disabled
Jan 18 2002  1.1    Changed all Jan 2001 changelog references to 2002.  Come on,
                     NOBODY caught this?
                    !! Moved entire project tree to autoconf
                    Moved 'config.[h|cc]' to 'configfile.[h|cc]'
                    Moved 'config.example' to 'kismet.conf'
                    Detect old libpcaps
                    Detect compiled ethereal
Jan 14 2002  1.1    Added FAQ to package.
                    Removed requirement for Ethereal - Packets are now handled 
                     via a "custom" common format, and dump files are now possible
                     with the common DumpFile class.
                    Wiretap dumper migrated to DumpFile format.
                    Added "dumptype" config and argument.  (warning: config change)
Jan 13 2002  1.1    Revamped sound playing method.  For some reason a fork() 
                     and exit() causes wtap file corruption.  Now uses a 
                     system() with a '&', which gives the same result.  Resolves
                     yesterdays dump corruption issues.
                    Fixed makefile message regarding config file installation 
                     so it doesn't say it's installing when it isn't.
Jan 12 2002  1.1    Const typing on packet dissectors.  Dumping (may) be broken, 
                     as yet unknown.
Jan 08 2002  1.1    Wrapped pcap.h in pcapsource.h in extern "C" {}.  Didn't 
                     create an error, but could have.
Jan 07 2002  1.1    Fixed pcap.h include in packet.h even if pcap not enabled.
Jan 06 2002  1.1    Added sound support (warning: config change)
                    Added mute command line option
                    Added generic UDP address discovery
                    De-WALLed source tree
                    Better From_DS and To_DS handling of packets, will no longer
                     erroneously attempt to do protocol dissection on them.
                    Fixed UDP/ARP address octet splitting
                    Updated flagset to show matched octets
                    Tweaked crypto logging
                    Added traffic decay config file option
                    Added sound hook - new network
                    Added sound hook - receiving traffic

Jan 04 2002  1.0    !! Release version 1.0

Jan 04 2002  1.0    Rewrote most documentation for general consumption.
                    Added 'make install' and 'make forceinstall'
                    Moved suid root priv drops to before where wtapfiles are 
                     opened to prevent someone from reading files they 
                     shouldn't.
                    Moved "capdev" config line to "capinterface"
                    Added "suid" option to configure
                    Moved *_promisc scripts to *_monitor, which is much closer
                     to the truth.
Jan 03 2002  1.0    Fixed DHCP detection
                    Changed "crypt" logtype to "weak" logtype
                    Added long-name command line options, wrote usage() function
                    Added reporting of failures in the GUI and pausing before
                    termination.
                    Fixed crypt file detection to use frame control fields.
Jan 02 2002  1.0    Fixed some annoying bugs (wtap_pkthdr != pcap_pkthdr)
                    Added "usage" output
                    Added support to load wtap dump files and process them as
                    live input.
                    Added additional command line switches to override the 
                    config file options.
Jan 01 2002  1.0    Added promisc/unpromisc scripts
                    Fixed encrypted packet detection
                    Fixed prism/2 capture length
                    Fixed aironet sniffing
Dec 31 2001  1.0    CDP product lists save correctly.  
                    Data/Probe networks with no SSID are migrated to 
                    named networks correctly as soon as a beacon packet is
                    received.
                    Fixed network dumpfile unlinking for captures of only
                    noisy packets.
                    Added "bad packet" buffer protection to try to prevent
                    segfaults should a bad packet escape bounds testing 
                    during dissection.
                    !! Correctly handle SUID root and drop privs as soon as
                    !! we don't need them any longer.
                    Added ability to compile without libpcap entirely for 
                    prism/2 only installations.
                    !! Added configure script to set up source directory and
                    !! libpcap support.
Dec 30 2001  1.0    Added support for CDP discovery protocols
                    Recoded packet dissection into bit fields
                    Translated bit-dependent ints into standard types
Dec 29 2001  1.0    DHCP dissector complete.
                    ARP dissector complete.
Dec 28 2001  1.0    Restructured display, added crypto detecting and 
                    airsnort format interesting logs, added packet-count
                    limited ethereal logs for people with weird versions 
                    that crash (Gambit) when opening large dumps, unlinking
                    of files when no network traffic, and beginnngs of 
                    TCPIP protocol dissectors to automatically extract the 
                    IP range of the network if certian protocol broadcasts
                    are seen.
Dec 25 2001  1.0    Recoded entire PacketSource engine to be class-based
                    and easily extendable.  Fixed display scrolling, added
                    more data packet detectors.
Dec 23 2001  1.0    Initial version.  Merry freaking christmas.
