Generic Linux Packet Engine
WARNING!  The generic engine, unlike any other capture engine, generates
observeable, active probe requests!

The generic engine is for cards supported under the linux-wireless
extentions which do not have RF monitor capability.  Origionally written
to support Orinoco cards, the patches by Snax have made it obsolete.

The generic capture source is useful ONLY for detecting SSIDs.  It isn't
capable of doing true sniffing, channel detection, wep detection, logging,
or counting packets correctly.

The generic packet source is basically equivalent to the method NetStumbler
uses to detect networks on Windows.  The wireless card is set to associate with
any network, and is then probed to report what network it's associated with.
This will only capture networks which are within transmit range of your card,
which aren't cloaked, and which don't have MAC filtering.  No traffic capture
will be done, however the probe requests that a card using the generic capture
method sends out can be observed from other stations.

The generic engine CAN NOT be used in a suid-root setup. Suid root typicaly 
drops privs immediately after binding to the device, since it can continue 
reading from the socket.  Unfortunately, to use the wireless kernel extentions,
the ioctls must be continually changed.  Rather than expose the system by 
remaining suid-root, privs are dropped and the capture will error out if Kismet
is not being run as root.
