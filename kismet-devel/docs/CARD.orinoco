Orinoco Cards

Orinoco cards do not support monitoring mode with any standard linux
drivers, however with the patches from Snax at http://airsnort.shmoo.com
they perform admirably.

Orinoco cards will only monitor a single channel at a time, use of 
the hopper (kismet_hopper) is reccomended and can be started automatically
by kismet_monitor -H.

pcap capture mode should be used with orinoco cards.
