# Kismet log files can contain many types of information; individual types can be
# disabled however.  Additionally, Kismet log files can be limited in duration, and
# automatically rolled to new files.
#
# Generally speaking, the individual options for logging should not need to be 
# modified, but in specific cases it may be valuable to disable log types.

# All logs can be disabled; this will disable logging system-wide.  Generally this
# should be left set to 'true'; logging can be turned off when Kismet is started 
# with the '-n' command line argument
enable_logging=true

# Logging is enabled by type; plugins may add additional types.  The log types can be
# overridden on the command line with the '--log-types' argument.
#
# Built-in log types (plugins may add more, consult the documentation for plugins):
#   kismet      Unified log which can be turned into multiple types of data
#   pcapng      Pcap-NG (suitable for use with Wireshark and Tshark, as well as other
#               tools) which contains raw pcap data with interface tags.  See the 
#               Kismet readme for methods to turn this into an old-style pcap log.
#
# By default, Kismet only enabled the unified 'kismet' log; the pcapng option is
# provided for special configurations as a legacy fallback mode.

# Devices are logged as complete objects.  Device logs are used to generate text 
# summaries of devices Kismet has seen, or to create reports.  Generally, you 
# will want to leave device logging enabled.

# Devices are logged at regular intervals; by default, once per minute.  This rate
# can be tuned for specific system requirements.

# Packet logging allows the generation of pcap files and post-processing of the
# packets seen by Kismet.  Generally, this should be left set to true.  This setting
# also controls the logging of packet-like metadata (such as spectrum sweeps and
# similar)

# Message logging saves any messages displayed on the console where Kismet was
# launched or in the messages tab of the UI
