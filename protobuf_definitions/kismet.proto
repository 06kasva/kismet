// Overall command structure used for all Kismet helper binaries;  Each command
// is an arbitrary string (command type), with a unique sequence number which is
// used in responses to the command.
//
// The payload of the command (content) is arbitrary, however Kismet uses 
// Google Protobuf for all embedded commands, and it strongly recommended that
// other implementations do as well.
// 
// This command is wrapped inside the kismet network structure which defines
// total length, embeds a checksum, and so on.
