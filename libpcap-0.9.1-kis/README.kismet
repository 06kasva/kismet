The Kismet modifications to this copy of libpcap simply remove the gencode.c
file and the packet filtering capabilities (Kismet uses its own packet filter).

The libpcap distributed with Kismet should not be used for anything else, and
the installer doesn't copy the libpcap.a file outside of the source tree.
