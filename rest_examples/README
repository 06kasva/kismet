Kismet Rest Examples


These examples show how to talk to Kismet programmatically over the HTTP
REST web API.

The Python examples use the KismetRest library, which is in this directory.
To install it, install as you would a normal Python module:
    $ cd KismetRest
    $ python2 ./setup.py build
    $ sudo python2 ./setup.py install

It may be necessary, on some distributions, to install the python setup tools
package, for example:
    $ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

As the Kismet API grows this Python code will likely need to change, up until
the first release when it will be version-matched.  If the example code doesn't
work, make sure you've updated your KismetRest library by re-running the build
and install phases.
