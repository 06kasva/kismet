# 802.11-specific configuration options

# 802.11 PHY frames are typically visible even when the data from the same devices 
# is hidden; for example an 802.11AC device may be visible to a non-802.11AC 
# sniffer when it sends lower data-rate PHY packets.
# Unfortunately, many devices (especially ath9k) also corrupt these frames, leading
# to tremendous false device detection.
# If you're sure your capture device doesn't generate bogus info, you can turn these on.
dot11_process_phy=false

# Enable device fingerprinting.  This is *required* to use the whitelisting features, but
# uses more RAM to store the fingerprints.
dot11_fingerprint_devices=true

# Access point fingerprinting for whitelisting is done by hashing IE tags to determine if
# they have changed.  Typically you shouldn't change this, but if you need to, you can change
# the IE tag numbers used to compute the hash here.
