# What type of dump do we generate? 
# valid option: "wiretap"

# logtemplate - Filename logging template.
# This is, at first glance, really nasty and ugly, but you'll hardly ever

#
# %n is replaced by the logging instance name

# %t is replaced by the starting log time
# %i is replaced by the increment log in the case of multiple logs
# %l is replaced by the log type (dump, status, crypt, etc)
# %h is replaced by the home directory
# ie, "netlogs/%n-%d-%i.dump" called with a logging name of "Pok" could expand
# to something like "netlogs/Pok-Dec-20-01-1.dump" for the first instance and 
# "netlogs/Pok-Dec-20-01-2.%l" for the second logfile generated.
# %h/netlots/%n-%d-%i.dump could expand to
# /home/foo/netlogs/Pok-Dec-20-01-2.dump
#
# Other possibilities:  Sorting by directory
# logtemplate=%l/%n-%d-%i
# Would expand to, for example,
# dump/Pok-Dec-20-01-1
# crypt/Pok-Dec-20-01-1
# and so on.  The "dump", "crypt", etc, dirs must exist before kismet is run
# in this case.
