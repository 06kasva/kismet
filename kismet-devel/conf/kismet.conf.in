# Kismet config file
# Most of the "static" configs have been moved to here -- the command line
# config was getting way too crowded and cryptic.  We want functionality,
# not continually reading --help!

# Version of Kismet config
version=2.9.1i

# Name of server (Purely for organiational purposes)
servername=Kismet

# User to setid to (should be your normal user)
suiduser=your_user_here

# Packet sources:
# source=capture_cardtype,capture_interface,capture_name
# Card type - Specifies the type of device. It can be one of:
#     cisco         - Cisco card with Linux Kernel drivers 
#     cisco_cvs     - Cisco card with CVS Linux drivers
#     cisco_bsd     - Cisco on *BSD
#     prism2        - Prism2 using wlan-ng drivers with pcap support (all 
#                      current versions support pcap)
#     prism2_hostap - Prism2 using hostap drivers
#     prism2_legacy - Prism2 using wlan-ng drivers without pcap support (0.1.9)
#     prism2_bsd    - Prism2 on *BSD
#     orinoco       - Orinoco cards using Snax's patched driers
#     generic       - Generic card with no specific support.  You will have 
#                      to put this into monitor mode yourself!
#     wsp100        - WSP100 embedded remote sensor.  
#     wtapfile      - Saved file of packets readable by libwiretap
#     ar5k          - ar5k 802.11a using the vt_ar5k drivers
#     drone         - Kismet remote drone
# Capture interface - Specifies the network interface Kismet will watch for
#  packets to come in on.  Typically "ethX" or "wlanX".  For the WSP100 capture
#  engine, the WSP100 device sends packets via a UDP stream, so the capture
#  interface should be in the form of host:port where 'host' is the WSP100 and 
#  'port' is the local UDP port that it will send data to.  
#  Kismet remote drones function similarly and the interface should be the
#  host:port of the drone.
#  CVS Cisco drivers split the interface into 2 components, ethX and wifiX.
#  They may not be the same, so for cisco_cvs the card type specifies 
#  ethX:wifiX
# Capture Name      - The name Kismet uses for this capture source.  This is the 
#   name used to specify what sources to enable.
# 
# To enable multiple sources, specify a source line for each and then use the
# enablesources line to enable them.  For example:
# source=prism2,wlan0,prism
# source=cisco,eth0,cisco
# source=cisco_cvs,eth1:wifi0,ciscocvs

source=cisco,eth0,Kismet

# Comma-separated list of sources to enable.  This is only needed if you wish 
# to selectively enable multiple sources.
# For example:
# enablesources=prismsource,ciscosource
enablesources=Kismet

# Port to serve GUI data
tcpport=2501
# People allowed to connect, comma seperated IP addresses or network/mask

# Host:port that GPSD is running on.  This can be localhost OR remote!

# Packet filtering options:
# filter_tracker - Packets filtered from the tracker are not processed or
#                  recorded in any way.
# filter_dump    - Packets filtered at the dump level are tracked, displayed,
#                  and written to the csv/xml/network/etc files, but not 
#                  recorded in the packet dump
# filter_export  - Controls what packets influence the exported CSV, network,
#                  xml, gps, etc files.
# All filtering options take arguments containing the type of address and
# addresses to be filtered.  Valid address types are 'ANY', 'BSSID',
# 'SOURCE', and 'DEST'.  Filtering can be inverted by the use of '!' before
# the address.  For example,
# filter_tracker=ANY(!00:00:DE:AD:BE:EF)
# has the same effect as the previous mac_filter config file option.
# filter_tracker=...
# filter_dump=...
# filter_export=...

# Alerts to be reported and the throttling rates.
# alert=name,throttle/unit,burst
# The throttle/unit describes the number of alerts of this type that are
# sent per time unit.  Valid time units are second, minute, hour, and day.
# Burst describes the number of alerts sent before throttling takes place.
# For example:
# alert=FOO,10/min,5
# Would allow 5 alerts through before throttling is enabled, and will then
# limit the number of alerts to 10 per minute.
# A throttle rate of 0 disables throttling of the alert.
# See the README for a list of alert types.
alert=NETSTUMBLER,5/min,2
alert=WELLENREITER,5/min,2
