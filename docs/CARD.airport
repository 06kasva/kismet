Airport Cards

In theory, Airport cards can work in Linux using a patched wavelan driver
(see CARD.orinoco), but I have not tested it.

Under OSX, there is no way of which I am aware to enable monitor mode.

The OSX wirelessdriver project (http://wirelessdriver.sourceforge.net) does
not currectly support airport cards.
