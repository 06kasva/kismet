<li>WHAT IS KISMET
<br>
Kismet is a 802.11 wireless network sniffer - this is different from a normal network 
sniffer (such as Ethereal or tcpdump) because it separates and identifies different
wireless networks in the area.  Kismet works with any 802.11b wireless card which is capable of
reporting raw packets (rfmon support), which include any prism2 based card (Linksys,
D-Link, Rangelan, etc), Cisco Aironet cards, and Orinoco based cards.  Kismet also
supports the WSP100 remote sensor by Network Chemistry, and is able to sniff 802.11a 
networks using ar5k cards.

<br>

<li>QUICK START
<br>
Detailed information about each of these steps can be found in the appropriate section
of the documentation.
<ol>
<li>Compile Kismet (./configure, make dep, make)
<li>Install Kismet (make install). By default, Kismet installs without suid-root ability.  This requires
you to start Kismet as root so that it can enable monitor mode and control channels.  Kismet CAN be 
installed as suid-root (make suidinstall) which allows you to start it as a normal user, HOWEVER this 
will allow any user on your system to stop the wireless connection.  Do NOT install Kismet suid-root 
if you have untrusted users on your system.
<li>Configure kismet.conf and kismet_ui.conf for your card and setup.  Make sure to put a valid, non-root 
user as the 'suiduser' option.  This user is the account kismet will run as once it has attached to the capture
source.  Most users will want to also edit the "logtemplate" field and put an absolute path to a directory 
that the suiduser has write permission to.
<li>Run 'kismet' as root (if installed normally) or simply run 'kismet' as any user if you installed it suid-root.  
Kismet will place the specified cards into rfmonitor mode and begin.
</ol>
<br>

<li>UPGRADING<br>
Upgrading to 2.9-devel and beyond<br>
Kismet-devel revamps major parts of Kismet.  There is a new alert system, and the hopper and monitor scripts
have been absorbed into Kismet itself and no longer need to be started seperately.  All users will need to 
read the documentation for how to install Kismet as a normal or a suid binary, and all users will need to 
upgrade to the new config files for alerts, hopping, etc to work correctly.
<br><br>

Upgrading to 2.8<br>
Kismet 2.8 adds support for several features, which necessitate changing the configure file.
All users should install Kismet with 'make forceinstall' and reconfigure it accordingly.<br>
New options include runtime WEP decoding, multiple sources, multiple servers under one client,
and many more new features.<br>

<li>SUPPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS<br>
	<ol>
	<li>Linux
	<br>
	Kismet was developed primarily on Linux, and should work on any distribution.
	<br>
	Kismet should compile with gcc 2.95.x and gcc 3.2.
	<br>
	Kismet is endian-clean and should compile on little (intel) and big (powerpc)
	endian systems.  It also works on ARM-based systems (Ipaq and Zaurus) and 
	SH3 (Jornada) handhelds.
	<br>
	<li>Linux-ARM
	<br>
		<ul>Zaurus Installation<br>
		Nearly all CF form-factor wireless cards are Prism/2 based.  As of this writing,
		the version of wlan-ng shipped with the Zaurus only supports the 'prism2' card 
		type.  A seperate package is provided with pcap support for OpenZaurus installs,
		which use HostAP and the prism_hostap card type.
		<ul>Ipaq Installation<br>
		Depending on the version of the Familiar distribution installed on your Ipaq,
		the version of the wlan-ng drivers may not support sniffing.  If you get errors
		that enabling monitor mode is not supported, you'll need to update your
		Familiar install or compile them yourself in a cross-build environment.
		<br>
		As of Familiar 0.5.3, Lucent/Orinoco cards do not support RFMON (PF_PACKET) and
		as such, cannot be used with Kismet without patching.  As of 8/28/02, Jamey
		Hicks who maintains the Familiar distribution promises future releases of
		Familiar will include Snax's patch for the orinoco_cs drivers.
		<br>
		Familiar users with Cisco cards will need to set their kismet.conf file to use
		a cardtype of "cisco_cvs", with a capinterface of "ethX:wifiX".
		<br>
		Some Familiar installs also do not include the latest ncurses and panels
		libraries - these can be obtained from the Skif cluster (telnet to
		ipaq3.handhelds.org and copy the /lib/libpanel.so.5 and /lib/libncurses.so.5.0
		files to your ipaq).  You may also need to install the GNU stdc++ libraries
		by running "ipkg install libstdc++2.01-glibc2.2".
		<br>
		Configure your card just as you would on an intel system - with the PCMCIA
		sleeve, all the standard cards function and must be configured as they
		would be on any other system.
		<ul>Compiling it yourself<br>
		Pass the appropriate cross-build to configure, I use<br>
		'./configure --host=arm-linux --disable-pcap --enable-zaurus --disable-setuid'<br>
		 to build for the Zaurus, and<br>
		'ac_cv_linux_vers=2.4.16 ./configure --host=arm-linux --with-pcap=linux 
			--disable-setuid'<br> 
		to build for the iPaq.  Set ac_cv_linux_vers accordingly to match your system.
		<br>
		Some versions of GCC appear to generate incorrect alignments when optimization
		is turned on.  If you experience bus errors under arm, try removing the -O2
		from the CXXFLAGS in the Makefile and recompiling.
		<br>
		I used the Zaurus cross-build environment from 
		http://www.lart.tudelft.nl/lartware/compile-tools/
		and the Skif cluster environment for Ipaq.
	</ul>
	<li>BSD
	<br>
	Kismet should configure and compile cleanly on *BSD.
	<br>
	Due to problems with the wireless drivers in FreeBSD and NetBSD, Kismet may not perform
	well or at all.  Thanks to the efforts of Pedro la Peu, Kismet WILL function
	without problems on OpenBSD 3.2 with prism/2 cards.
	<br>
	The lions share of drivers supporting rfmon are available only for Linux, so
	for general use, using Linux to run Kismet is highly reccomended.  Some driver maintainers
	for the BSD variants have expressed no interest in providing support for monitoring tools,
	so it is unknown when useful drivers for rfmon will be available.
	<br>
	The standard './configure' script should detect your OS and configure itself
	accordingly.  It is vital that you use 'gmake' instead of 'make' to 
	compile however -- most *BSD make's do NOT like the GNU makefile format very
	much.
	<br>
	I'm definitely NOT a BSD expert.  If you experience problems, probably the best
	course to take is to report them to the mailing list 
	(wireless@kismetwireless.net).
	<br>
	<li>Win32 (Cygwin)
	<br>
	The Kismet panels frontend will compile and run under Cygwin on win32.
	<br>
	The Kismet server will work under cygwin with the wsp100 source or the drone remote
	source.  No other sources can currently be used because no publicly available 
	drivers for win32 can support rfmon.
	<br>
	To compile Kismet under win32, use:
	<br>
	./configure --disable-pcap --without-ethereal --disable-gps --disable-wireless 
	--disable-netlink --disable-suid-root --enable-wsp100
	<br>
	<li>MacOS X
	<br>
	Kismet will compile under OSX, however currently only the client is useful.  The 
	Kismet server component will work with the wsp100 or the drone remote sources. The
	Viha drivers DO support rfmon under OSX, and as soon as a Viha capture source is
	written Kismet should work natively in OSX, however this has not yet happened.
	Anyone interested in working on a Viha capture source should contact me.
	</ol>
<li>SUPPORTED CARD TYPES
	<ol>
	<li>CISCO
	<br>
	Cards: Aironet 340, Aironet 350
	<br>
	Notes: Cisco cards use an internal firmware channel hopper.  kismet_hopper is not
	needed, and with all current drivers, user-controlled channel hopping is not possible.
	<ul>
		<li>'cisco': Linux kernel 2.4.10 through 2.4.19<br>
		Capture interface:  ethX<br>
		Notes: Built-in Linux kernel drivers for the aironet cards (airo and airo_cs).  These
		are, currently, the most reliable drivers to use.<br>
		<br>
		<li>'cisco_cvs': Linux kernel 2.4.20, sourceforge.net CVS driver release<br>
		Capture interface:  ethX:wifiX<br>
		Notes:  The new drivers use the interface ethX for normal operation and wifiX for
		raw packet capturing.  The interface for Kismet should be set to wifiX.  These drivers
		have a history of locking up under high loads and when entering/leaving rfmon mode.
		<br>
		<li>'cisco_bsd': BSD 'an' drivers<br>
		Capture interface:  anX<br>
		Notes:  The 'an' drivers do not report the linktype or packets reliably under most
		BSD versions.  Performance may be varied.
	</ul>
	<br>
	<li>PRISM/2
	<br>
	Cards:  Prism/2 based PCMCIA, PCI, PLX, Compact Flash, and USB cards by a variety of 
		manufacturers, including Linksys, D-Link, Zoom, Demarctech, Microsoft, and many others.
	<br>
	Notes:  Prism/2 users should use kismet_hopper to channel hop.  WARNING:  The 22mbit
	cards made by manufacturers such as D-Link (labeled as 650+ among others) are NOT
	Prism/2 based.  They use a proprietary TI chipset, which is currently NOT supported by
	any drivers in Linux or BSD, and cannot be used.  Additionally, recent PCI cards by 
	Linksys and others use a Broadcom chipset instead of Prism/2, which is not supported.
	<ul>
		<li>'prism2':  Wlan-ng 0.1.14 and higher.<br>
		Capture interface:  wlanX<br>
		Notes:  Recent wlan-ng development drivers report PHY (physical layer) packets
		such as data-ack and request-to-send.  Logging of these can be controlled with
		the 'phylog' option.
		<br>
		<li>'prism2_avs':  Wlan-ng 0.2.0 and higher.<br>
		Capture interface:  wlanX<br>
		Notes:  Wlan-ng 0.2.0 introduces a new capture header with MUCH more information
		from the radio.  Kismet doesn't entirely take advantage of these new headers
		yet, but wherever possible, use the prism2_avs capture source.  As Wlan-ng 0.2.0+
		becomes more widely adopted, prism2_avs will become the default prism2 behavior.
		<br>
		<li>'prism2_legacy':  Legacy wlan-ng drivers (0.1.13 and earlier)<br>
		Capture interface:  wlanX<br>
		Notes:  All users able to do so should upgrade their wlan-ng drivers to a newer
		version.  For those forced to use the older drivers, prism2_legacy uses the
		linux-netlink-socket capture interface.
		<br>
		<li>'prism2_hostap':  hostap<br>
		Capture interface:  wlanX<br>
		Notes:  The hostap drivers appear to frequently change the commands used to
		place them into monitor mode.  When in doubt, consult the hostap documentation.
		<br>
		<li>'prism2_bsd':  BSD Prism/2 drivers<br>
		Notes:  OpenBSD 3.2 has Prism/2 drivers which correctly report the link type and
		packets.  Other BSD versions have, at best, mixed results.
		<br>
	</ul>
	<li>ORINOCO
	<br>
	Cards:  Lucent orinoco based cards such as the WaveLAN series and by some reports Airport.
	<br>
	Notes:  Apple Airport cards are reported to also work with these drivers with some 
	effort.  kismet_hopper handles channel hopping.  Currently, no BSD drivers exist which
	are capable of doing rfmon mode.
	<ul>
		<li>'orinoco':  Patched Linux orinoco drivers<br>
		Capture interface: ethX<br>
		Notes:  Drivers must be patched with the rfmon patches at http://airsnort.shmoo.com.
		Unpatched drivers will not work in rfmon mode.
		<br>
	</ul>
	<li>WSP100
	<br>
	Device: WSP100 Remote Sniffer from Network Chemistry
	<br>
	Notes:  The WSP100 remote sensor is a SNMP-controlled embedded device that 
	reports packets via a UDP stream.  This should work on ANY platform including Win32 (cygwin),
	Max OS X, Linux, BSD, and anywhere else you can get Kismet to compile.  kismet_hopper will
	configure the wsp100 firmware for internal channel hopping.
	<ul>
		<li>'wsp100':  Kismet UDP handler<br>
		Capture interface:  host:port<br>
		Notes: The capture interface specifies the address of the wsp100 unit and the port
		to send the UDP packet stream to.
		<br>
	</ul>
	<li>WTAPFILE
	<br>
	Notes:  The wtapfile replay ability is primarily useful for debugging, however it can also
	be used to recreate csv/xml/etc files from a saved dump.
	<ul>
		<li>'wtapfile':  Kismet wtapfile handler<br>
		Capture interface:  file<br>
		Notes:  The capture interface specifies the path to the dump file.  Dumps can be
		in any format wtaplib understands, which includes files created by Kismet, Ethereal,
		TCPdump, and others.  Files can be gzip compressed.  File replaying can be slowed down
		using the '-M' command line option.  -M100 is typical.
		<br>
	</ul>
	<li>AR5K
	<br>
	Notes:  802.11a doesn't put the channel in the beacon headers.
	<ul>
        <li>'ar5k':  vt_ar5k Linux 802.11a drivers<br>
        Capture interface:  wlanX<br>
		Notes:  The vt_ar5k drivers require the Linux wireless-tools version 25 or
		higher.  Older versions will not be able to put the cards into monitor mode.
		<br>
	</ul>
	<li>DRONE REMOTE
	<br>
	Notes:  The packets sent by Kismet drones may be filtered by the drone itself for
	content (physical, beacon, etc.).
	<ul>
		<li>'drone': Kismet Drone remote<br>
		Capture interface: host:port<br>
		Notes:  The capture interface specifies the address of the Kismet drone server and
		the port on that server which provides packets.
		<br>
	</ul>
	</ol>
<li>GPS SUPPORT
<br>
GPS support is provided via the GPSD daemon, available at http://russnelson.com/gpsd/.  
GPSD is also included with the navigation software GPSDrive.  Current versions of GPSDrive
distribute a GPSD which will work with Kismet, however earlier versions (1.17 and earlier)
did not.
<br>
GPSD provides network accessable GPS data from a wide variety of GPS recievers, including
Garmin, Magellan, and more.  Kismet can use a GPSD running on the local server or on a
remote host (assuming that there is a wired connection to that host).
<br>
Kismet will write an XML logfile of the travel path taken and the packets seen.  The 
gpsmap program that comes with Kismet will plot these files to a graphical map.
<br>
Some systems have trouble compiling GPSD.  The easiest fix is to edit
em.c and change "#include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;" to "#include &lt;time.h&gt;".
<li>COMPILING &amp; INSTALLATION
<br>
Before configuration and compilation, you should get the following packages:
<ul>
<li>
ethereal (www.ethereal.com).  This is a GREAT sniffer and capture reader, 
  and will be invaluable to you for processing dump files.  Kismet will also 
  use Ethereal's wiretap packet library for dumping and reading dumpfiles 
  if it is available.
<li>
gpsdrive (http://www.kraftvoll.at/software/).  This program does
  real-time street mapping and other useful GPS things, and includes gpsd,
  the daemon Kismet interfaces to for GPS support.  Alternatively, you can get
  just the daemon from http://russnelson.com/gpsd/.  This is NOT required for
  compilation but you need the gpsd daemon running for GPS logging when you
  go to run Kismet.  New versions of GPSdrive will interface directly with Kismet
  and plot access points realtime.  See the GPSDrive documentation for more details.
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
Run the ./configure script.  This will find as much as possible about
   your system.  Most configuration options are autodetected, you should only
   need to override them for custom compilations if you are attempting to save
   space (such as for a handheld).  Useful configuration options include:
<br>
  --disable-curses        disable curses UI
<br>
  --disable-panel         disable ncurses panel extentions
<br>
  --disable-gps           disable GPS support
<br>
  --disable-netlink       disable linux netlink socket capture (prism2/orinoco 
                          patched)
<br>
  --disable-wireless      disable linux kernel wireless extentions
<br>
  --disable-pcap          disable libpcap capture support
<br>
  --enable-syspcap        use system libpcap (not reccomended)
<br>
  --disable-setuid        disable suid capabilities (not reccomended)
<br>
  --enable-wsp100         enable WSP100 remote sensor capture device
<br>
  --enable-zaurus         enable some extra stuff (like piezzo buzzer) for 
                          Zaurus
<br>
  --enable-local-dumper   force use of local dumper code even if ethereal is 
                          present
<br>
  --with-ethereal=DIR     support ethereal wiretap for logs 
<br>
  --without-ethereal      disable support for ethereal wiretap
<br>
  --enable-acpi           Enable linux-kernel ACPI support
<li> Run 'make dep' and 'make install'
<li> Edit kismet.conf (default install path, /usr/local/etc/kismet.conf) to set your 
	logging type and preferences.
<li> Edit kismet_ui.conf (default install path, /usr/local/etc/kismet_ui.conf) to set 
	your interface preferences.
</ol>
<br>
Unless you specify --disable-setuid, Kismet will be installed as suid-root.
Immediately after binding to the capture source, it will drop root privileges
and run as the user specified in the config file.  This suid behavior will 
occur when kismet is run as root or as the user specified in the config file.
<br>
It is reccomended that you do NOT disable this capability, as Kismet is 
handling potentially hostile foreign data and should not have elevated rights
to the system.
<li>CONFIGURATION<br>
Kismet is controlled by 2 system-wide config files (by default, in /usr/local/etc/).  These
files use a simple option=value format.<br>
<ul>
	<li>kismet.conf<br>
	kismet.conf controls the behavior of the server itself, including capture sources,
	logging, GPS support, etc.  All of the options are documented inside the file, as well
	as in the man page kismet.conf(5).  
	<br>
	<ul>
	<li>Configuring capture sources<br>
	Kismet capture sources define the type of device and the interface that Kismet will
	listen for packets on.  Most systems will only have one capture source, but Kismet can
	support any number of simultaneous captures.  The data captured from multiple interfaces
	will be multiplexed to a single dump file.  Sources can be passed on the command line,
	but are primarily controlled by 'source' lines in kismet.conf.
	<br>
	Each source line consists of the type, interface, and name, separated by commas.
	<br>
	source=cisco,eth0,Cisco
	<br>
	defines a cisco card on interface eth0 named 'Cisco',
	<br>
	source=prism2,wlan0,Prism
	<br>
	defines a prism2 card using the wlan-ng drivers on interface wlan0 named 'Prism'.
	<br>
	If multiple sources are defined, all will be enabled by default, unless an "enablesources"
	option is given. 
	<br>
	<li>Configuring fuzzy encryption<br>
	Not all capture sources report the WEP flags on incoming packets correctly.  Fuzzy 
	encryption detection attempts to classify packets by matching known LLC types and treating
	unknown packets as encrypted.
	<br>
	Don't use fuzzy encryption unless your drivers report encrpyted packets as unencrypted.
	<br>
	<li>Filtering packet logs<br>
	What packets are logged to the dump file can be filtered using the 'noiselog', 'beaconlog',
	and 'phylog' options in kismet.conf.
	<br>
	Disabling noise logging discards any packets classified as noise - spurious packets from
	some drivers, packets which are too short to contain the data they claim, etc.
	<br>
	Disabling beacon logging discards all but one beacon packet per network seen.  Additional 
	beacon packets may be logged if the advertised SSID changes.
	<br>
	Disabling phy logging discards physical layer packets such as data acks which some drivers
	report.
	<br>
	<li>Decrypting wep on-the-fly<br>
	Kismet supports decrypting WEP as packets are captured.  This enables Kismet to extract
	clients, IP ranges, and alert conditions out of WEP-enabled traffic.  WEP keys are set
	via the "wepkey" option.  Multiple wepkey options can be set to decrypt different networks.
	Each wepkey line should be the bssid and the hex key, for example:<br>
	wepkey=00:FE:ED:BE:EF:00,00:11:22:33:44<br>
	WEP keys can be 5 hex pairs (40-bit) or 13 hex pairs (128-bit)<br>
	<li>Using an external IDS<br>
	By configuring a FIFO named pipe (fifo="..." in kismet.conf), Kismet will create the
	specified pipe and write the data packets to it.  If a packet can be decrypted with a
	known key, it will be modified and written as an unencrypted packet to the FIFO.<br>
	External IDS programs (such as Snort) should be instructed to read packets from a file
	or pipe.<br>
	When writing packets to a FIFO pipe, Kismet will pause during the startup procedure until
	an external utility opens the pipe for reading.<br>
	</ul>
	<li>kismet_ui.conf<br>
	kismet_ui.conf controls the behavior of the user interface - colors, columns, default
	server, etc.  All of the options are documented inside the file, as well as in
	kismet_ui.conf(5).
	<br>
	<ul>
	<li>Changing columns<br>
	The informational columns the Kismet panels interface (default) uses can be changed by the
	'columns' option for the main network display and the 'clientcolumns' option for the client
	display in kismet_ui.conf.  A complete list of columns is in the man page.
	<br>
	<li>Changing colors<br>
	Nearly all the elements of the Kismet interface can be changed via the kismet_ui.conf file
	any the 'xxxcolor' options.  The config file and the man page list all the possible colors
	and configurable elements.
	<br>
	</ul>
</ul>
<li>PANELS INTERFACE<br>
	Kismet's primary user interface uses the curses extention library, panels.  Other interfaces
i	can be connected at will.
	<br>
	<ul>
	<li>Basics of the panels interface<br>
		The panels interface is divided into three primary panels:
		<ol>
		<li>Network display view<br>
			The network display panel shows all the networks which have been discovered.  This
			list can be sorted and manipulated.
			<br>
		<li>Information view<br>
			The information panel shows the total number of packets, current packet rate, 
			amount of time the capture has been running, etc.
			<br>
		<li>Status view<br>
			The status panel scrolls information and status events.  Alerts appear in this
			panel, as well as in the alert popup.
		</ol>
		<br>
		In addition to these three primary panels, additional popup windows can be requested to
		display detailed information about a network, overall statistics, rename a network group,
		and a number of other operations.
	<br>
	<li>Interacting with Kismet<br>
		<ul>
		<li>'e' - Open popup window of Kismet servers.  This lets you simultaneously monitor
			two or more Kismet servers on different hosts.
		<li>'z' - Zoom network display panel to full screen (or return it to normal size if 
			it is already zoomed)
		<li>'m' - Mute sound and speech if they are enabled (or unmute them if they were 
			previously silenced).  You must have sound or speech enabled in your config to be
			able to mute or unmute them.
		<li>'t' - Tag (or untag) the current network
		<li>'g' - Group currently tagged networks
		<li>'u' - Ungroup current group
		<li>'c' - Open client popup window to display clients in the selected network
		<li>'n' - Rename selected network or group
		<li>'i' - Display detailed information about the current network or group
		<li>'s' - Sort the network list differently

<li>MAPPING<br>
	Gpsmap (which comes with Kismet) takes GPS and network data (.gps and .xml files, respectively)
	and plots them graphically on vector, satellite, or user supplied maps.
	<br>
	Gpsmap supports several drawing methods:
	<ol>
	<li>Track drawing<br>
		Draws a track along the traveled path, based on the saved track data.
	<li>Bounding rectangle<br>
		Draws the bounding rectangle around the extreme points of each network.
	<li>Range circle<br>
		Draws the estimated range of a network as a circle around the center point.
	<li>Convex hull<br>
		Draws the convex hull of the network (smallest polygon which covers all network points)
	<li>Scatter plot<br>
		Draws a point for every logged packet
	<li>Center dot<br>
		Draws a point in the estimated center of each network
	<li>Interpolated power<br>
		By far the most CPU intensive, power interpolation forms a grid over the image
		and attempts to interpolate the power for points that aren't directly sampled.
		For this graph to be a reasonable representation of reality, samples around
		the entire area, preferably forming a grid or mesh, should be taken.
	</ol>
	More information about gpsmap is available from the man page gpsmap(1).
<li>DRONE REMOTES<br>
	Kismet is also able to do distributed sniffing of a larger physical area by using
	Drone remote sniffers.  A Kismet drone is essentially a stripped down Kismet sniffer
	engine which is able to capture data from all the same sources as Kismet itself (as well
	supporting multiple simultaneous capture sources, mixture of 802.11a and 802.11b 
	sources, etc) and provide those packets over a TCP stream on a wired network.
	<br>
	Any number of drones with any number of sources can be distributed across the target
	area, with all captured packets being processed by a single Kismet server, stored in a
	common dump file and passed to a single Snort IDS instance, if desired.
<li>INTRUSION DETECTION<br>
	Kismet will examine the headers and payload information of 802.11 traffic,
	and will generate alerts when it encounters traffic that matches defined
	attack signatures.  Kismet is unlike other traditional IDS's since it will
	analyze traffic at the data-link level, instead of just examining properties
	specific to the IP family of protocols.  Kismet is also capable of anomaly
	analysis over a defined period of time to detect attacks that cannot be
	detected with simple per-packet matching patterns.
	<br>
	In addition to Kismets link-layer IDS, Kismet can interface with traditional
	IDS implementations like Snort (www.snort.org) via a named pipe (See the
	section about configuring Kismet to write to FIFO/Named pipes) to form a
	complete IDS solution.  Distributed sniffing via Drone Remotes and WEP
	decoding of known networks lets you monitor your entire wireless coverage
	area.

	<ul>
	<li>NETSTUMBLER<br>
	Alert on: Netstumbler Probe<br>
	Alert message: "NetStumbler ($version) probe detected from $source"<br>
	References: www.netstumbler.com<br>
	Tool specific: Yes<br>
	Implemented in: NetStumber 3.22, 3.23, 3.30<br>
	Details: NetStumbler is a Windows program to perform active discovery of
		WLAN networks through probe request scanning.  After NetStumbler
		locates a WLAN, it will probe the AP for "nickname" information.
		This probe contains a specific payload that will cause Kismet to
		generate an alert.<br>
	<li>DEAUTHFLOOD<br>
	Alert on: Deauthenticate/Disassociate Flood<br>
	Alert message:  "Deauthenticate/Disassociate flood on $targetbssid"<br>
	References: 802.11ninja.net, http://home.jwu.edu/jwright/papers/l2-wlan-ids.pdf<br>
	Tool specific: No<br>
	Implemented in: AirJack, fata-jack, void11, others<br>
	Details: By sending deauthenticate or disassociate message to clients or
			a layer 2 broadcast address with a spoofed source address of the
			legitimate AP, an attacker can launch a DoS attack against a
			target network.  This type of attack only lasts as long as the
			attacker sustains the deauthenticate flood.<br>
	<li>LUCENTTEST<br>
	Alert on: Lucent link test<br>
	Alert message: "Lucent Link Test detected from $clientmac"<br>
	References: http://www.agere.com/wlan/customercare/ (requires login)<br>
	Tool specific: Yes<br>
	Implemented in: Lucent/Orinoco WaveManager site survey software<br>
	Details: Lucent/Orinoco/Agere/Proxim provides site survey software with
			their AP's.  This rule will generate an alert when this
			software is in use.<br>
	<li>WELLENREITER<br>
	Alert on: Wellenreiter SSID brute force<br>
	Alert message: "Wellenreiter probe detected from $clientmac"<br>
	References: http://home.jwu.edu/jwright/papers/l2-wlan-ids.pdf
			http://home.jwu.edu/jwright/papers/wlan-mac-spoof.pdf<br>
	Tool specific: Yes<br>
	Implemented in: Wellenreiter 1.6, Wellenreiter 1.5<br>
	Details: Wellenreiter has an option to brute-force the ESSID of a
			discovered access point by attempting multiple associations
			from a list of potential SSID's.  Between each association
			attempt, Wellenreiter will reset the card ESSID to
			"this_is_used_for_wellenreiter".  Kismet will raise this alert
			when the SSID "this_is_used_for_wellenreiter" is detected.<br>
	<li>CHANCHANGE<br>
	Alert on: Known BSSID changing channel<br>
	Alert message: "Beacon on $bssid ($ssid) for channel $newchannel, previously detected on channel $oldchannel"<br>
	Tool specific: No<br>
	Implemented in: AirJack, others<br>
	Details: Many attacks attempt to divert clients from a legitimate network to another
			channel.  This alert is raised when a beacon is seen for a different channel
			than the one the network was previously communicating on.<br>
	<li>BCASTDISCON<br>
	Alert on: Broadcast disassociation or deauthentication packets<br>
	Alert message: "Broadcast [disassociation|deauthentication] on $bssid"<br>
	Tool specific: No<br>
	Implemented in: AirJack, fata-jack, void11, others<br>
	Details: Many attacks use a broadcast disassociate or deauthenticate packet to 
			knock all of the users off a network.  This can be a prolonged into a sustained 
			DOS attack, used to decloak a hidden SSID, or be the precursor of a man in the
			middle attacks.  Broadcast disassociations are rarely, if ever, legitimate.
			This alert is raised whenever a broadcast disassociation is seen.<br>
	<li>AIRJACKSSID<br>
	Alert on: Beacon for SSID "airjack"<br>
	Alert message: "Beacon for SSID 'airjack' from $sourcemac"<br>
	Tool specific: Yes<br>
	Implemented in: AirJack<br>
	Details: The defcon/blackhat AirJack test code sets the card to beacon as the SSID "airjack" while performing
			other attacks.  This alert is raised whenever a beacon packet for the SSID "airjack" is seen.<br>
	<li>PROBENOJOIN<br>
	Alert on: Clients seen probing and receiving acknowledgements but not participating in a network.
	Alert message: "Suspicious client $sourcemac - probing networks but never joining."<br>
	Tool specific: No<br>
	Implemented in: NetStumbler, other active-probe scanners.<br>
	Details: Clients which probe continually for networks, are accepted, and never participate are likely to be 
	stumbler clients looking for networks.  There is a chance of false positives with this detection method, but 
	it can be effective when watching for stumblers.<br>
	<li>DISASSOCTRAFFIC<br>
	Alert on: Traffic from a given source within 10 seconds of a disassociate or deauthenticate.<br>
	Alert message: "Suspicious traffic on $sourcemac:  Data traffic within 10 seconds of disassociate."<br>
	Tool specific: No<br>
	Implemented in: "802.11 Denial-of-Service Attacks: Real Vulnerabilities and Practical Solutions" research paper.<br>
	Details:  As discussed in the above research paper by Bellardo, J. and Savage, S., a host which legitimately 
	disassociates or deauthenticates from a network should not be exchanging data immediately thereafter.  Any 
	client which DOES exchange data within 10 seconds of disassociating from the network should be considered a likely 
	victim of a disassociate attack.<br>
