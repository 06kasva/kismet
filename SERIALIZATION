Kismet uses msgpack (via msgpack-c / libmsgpack) to handle inter-process
and inter-device serialization.

Elements packed for exchange are wrapped in packed arrays reflecting their
internal type (as an integer based on the trackedelement.h list of fields):

    [ <type>, <value> ]

Thus a map could be represented as:

    [ 14, {'field.name': value} ]

Nested values also include the type, thus:

    [ 14, {'field.name': [ 5, 5.0 ] } ]

would represent a map (type 14) where the key 'field.name' resolves to a float
(type 5), value 5.0f

* NOTE - Absolute type values may change, consult trackedelement.h *


Some special types require additional encoding:
    mac_addr        Mac addresses are encoded as array pairs containing the uint64 
                    representation of the mac address and the mac address mask.
