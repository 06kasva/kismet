To be replaced soon.  See README.newcore for devel info.

NOTE: NEWCORE HAS CHANGED HOW THINGS ARE CONFIGURED IN SOME SIGNIFICANT
WAYS, BUT BY USING DIFFERENT OPTIONS THE CONFIG FILE CAN STILL BE SHARED WITH
KISMET-STABLE.  REFER TO THE KISMET DEVEL BLOG, THIS README, AND THE COMMENTS
IN CONF/KISMET.CONF FOR THE NEW CONFIGURATION OPTIONS.

New security model:

Kismet now uses a suid-root group-exec-only helper binary called kismet_capture
which allows it to control and capture from interfaces.  When installed in suid
mode, this program will be installed as group-executable only for the Kismet
group.

Kismet can be run without installation and WITHOUT PRIVILEGE SEPARATION by
running it out of the source directory as root.

In either use, this REMOVES the need to specify a user to drop privs to.

Newcore sources:

In an attempt to make it easier to configure, Newcore has a new source config
format:

ncsource=interface[:[option,]+]

For interfaces where autodetect is supported, all that is needed is
ncsource=wlan0

For interfaces where autodetect does not work (for example, madwifi with no
supporting VAPs), the "type" option is used:

ncsource=wifi0:type=madwifi_g

Multiple options can be included:

ncsource=wlan0:name=intel,hop=false,channel=11

Available source options:
    name=foo            Name the source (otherwise it will be referred 
                         to by the interface)
    type=foo            Set the type (such as iwl4965, madwfifi_g, etc) for types
                         which can not be auto-detected
    uuid=foo            Force a specific UUID for this source (not needed for
                         most users)
    hop=true|false      Control hopping on this source
    velocity=#          Set the channel hop velocity of this source
    weakvalidate        Do not strongly force packet validation (somtimes needed
                         for handling FCS data)
    channellist=list    Use named channel list
    channel=#           Set a channel/frequency
    dwell=#             Dwell on each channel for # seconds
    split=true|false    Disable channel list splitting (will not share a list of
                         channels over multiple sources)
    vap=interface       Create a VAP interface (mac80211)

Newcore channels:

In an attempt to make it easier to configure, Newcore has a new channel config
format:

channellist=name:channel,channel,channel

Additionally individual channels can be weighted so that more time is spent
on them:

channellist=foo:1:3,6:3,11:3,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10

would wait 3 times longer on channels 1, 6, 11 than on the other channels.
